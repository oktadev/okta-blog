Interested in Android development? Then you should get familiar with Gradle, the only Android development build system that Google officially supports.

Gradle manages all aspects of the Android development process, making it easy to:

* Compile your code
* Solve dependency trees and conflicts between libraries
* Merge your code and resources with those of your libraries
* Cache resources for compilation performance
* Connect it all to the Android SDK
* Finally packaging it into the right format with the appropriate signature

In true Android fashion, you can configure most aspects of Gradle's behavior by providing Gradle with different configuration options. Going further, lots of freely available plugins add features to Gradle: extended error reporting, custom app icons, integration with other systems, etc.  You can also use Groovy or Kotlin to create your own completely custom plugins.

This article will introduce you to the essential aspects of what Gradle does and how you can configure it I'll also introduce you to a couple more advanced Gradle concepts.

Your App will also use Okta to safely and easily authenticate users, so you can focus on your business while Okta gives you the security you need, plus services like:

* User [Authentication](https://developer.okta.com/product/authentication/) and [Authorization](https://developer.okta.com/product/authorization/)
* User-data storage
* [Social login](https://developer.okta.com/authentication-guide/social-login/)
* [Multi-factor authentication](https://developer.okta.com/use_cases/mfa/)

This article follows an example Android app that authenticates a user with [Okta's SDK for Android](https://developer.okta.com/code/android/) and demonstrates Gradle in Android. Please clone and set it up yourself, so you can follow along.  
What you will also need:

* [A Free Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

Let's get started!

## Set Up Your Android App to work With Okta and Gradle

First, clone the [Okta Android sample app repo](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-android/blob/master/app/README.md) and open it with Android Studio:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-android
cd okta-oidc-android
```

{% include setup/cli.md type="native" loginRedirectUri="com.okta.dev-133337:/callback" logoutRedirectUri="com.okta.dev-133337:/logout" %}

Create a *config.json* file similar to this one in the *app* module's `/app/res/raw` folder:

```json
{
  "client_id": "{clientId}",
  "redirect_uri": "{yourReversedOktaDomain}:/callback",
  "end_session_redirect_uri": "{yourReversedOktaDomain}:/logout",
  "scopes": [
    "openid",
    "profile",
    "offline_access"
  ],
  "discovery_uri": "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default"
}
```

Set a *URI Scheme* unique to your app in the *app* module's `/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android.defaultConfig.manifestPlaceholders = [
    "appAuthRedirectScheme": "{yourReversedOktaDomain}"
]
```

Add your Okta domain to your `/local.properties` file at the root of the project:

```properties
authn.orgUrl="https://dev-######.okta.com"
```

If you want to learn more about Okta, check out the [Add Identity Management to Your Android App](https://developer.okta.com/code/android/) section of the Okta documentation for Android.

## How Gradle Uses Tasks

Any time you use Android Studio to build an app, install an app, or clean a project, it executes a Gradle *task*, a set of instructions very similar to the functions in your code. Some tasks like *clean* (which deletes a folder) will execute just a couple of instructions, and some other tasks like *assemble* (which builds a whole app) will trigger a whole sequence of other tasks.

To see an example of a very simple task, you can find the definition of the clean task in /build.gradle

```groovy
task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
```

Android Studio defines some tasks, like *clean*, by default in our project's configuration files, but each plugin in our project could come with tasks as well. The simplest Android project already has many Gradle tasks available through the Android plugin.

You can easily get a list of all the Gradle tasks in your project in a few ways. If you like the command-line route, you can execute in the root of your project:

```bash
./gradlew tasks
```

If you use Android Studio 3 or a newer version, you can see all the tasks listed in a tab called *Gradle* on the right side of your workspace. This will give you a list of nicely categorized tasks you can run with a simple double-click:

{% img blog/android-gradle/android-gradle-tasks-list-AS.jpg alt:"Android gradle tasks list" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Although we won't dive into the creation of custom tasks, I encourage you to expand your knowledge with [Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.Task.html) after reading this article.

## How Gradle Builds an Android App

Every time you build an app,  a progress report in the bottom of Android Studio shows a list of different elements:

{% img blog/android-gradle/android-gradle-build-output.jpg
 alt:"Android gradle build output" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

This is the list of tasks Gradle completes to build the app. While Gradle handles these all automatically, it's worth going through them to get a sense of what we can configure later on.

1. Prepare for the build

    First, you can execute a sequence of tasks to make Gradle aware of all the configuration values used during the compilation, to verify the validity of all the tasks we defined or a plugin defined, and to make sure all dependencies/libraries defined in the project can be resolved.

    These actions ensure Gradle is properly configured. If you ever wondered what the "Sync Now" prompt does, this is it.

    {% img blog/android-gradle/android-gradle-sync-now.jpg alt:"Android gradle sync now" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

2. Compile the source code

    To run Android applications, all source code must be compiled into *dex* files. This is a type of bytecode specific to Android that is an optimized version of the compiled source code.
    The tools for converting source code into dex files have changed over time, but Gradle still manages the tools and provides them with the required configuration (which we as developers might decide to modify).

3. Merge manifests, resources, and assets

    Every dependency of the project might define its own manifest, resources like drawables, etc.
    All of them put together generate the final app. This approach allows Android to detect conflicts between resources early on, so it can warn developers.

4. Sign and package

    Once all the code, all the dependencies, and all the resources are ready, Gradle will create a single **A**ndroid **P**ac**k**age (apk) from them and sign the result.

The apk file will contain:

* a Manifest describing its contents
* one or multiple dex/bytecode files
* multiple resources
* a list of all those resources
* a signature to verify the authorship of the apk

You can then install the apk in an Android device or an emulator to use your app.

## How to Configure Gradle in Android

Android Studio 3.2 introduced a much more advanced version of the Project Structure dialog, which you can use to configure most of the essential Gradle options.

{% img blog/android-gradle/android-gradle-project-structure.jpg alt:"Android gradle project structure" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

This dialog is still in development and requires you to understand what each of the configuration options implies and even how Gradle organizes projects. Whether you decide to use the Project Structure or the traditional configuration files, the following points will help you understand how to work with either of them.

### Gradle Project Structure

Gradle splits projects into modules. In Android's case, a simple app would be a project with a single module (the app module):

{% img blog/android-gradle/android-gradle-modules.png alt:"Android gradle modules" width:"500" %}{: .center-image }

Image from [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/index.html)

You can configure the Gradle project by modifying the `/build.gradle` file at the root of the project. These changes will affect the whole project, including all modules.

Each module can be configured in each module-specific *build.gradle* file. In our case, for instance, we can modify the `/app/build.gradle` file to  change how Gradle handles the *app* module.

## Essential Configuration Options for Gradle in Android

Android users currently run a wide variety of [Android versions](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards).
To allow apps built for newer Android versions to run in older Android versions as well, developers must include many "compatibility layers" in apps.

For instance, if an app built for Android 9 runs on an  Android 8 device, this device will run the code compiled for Android 9, plus a compatibility layer that translated some of the Android 9 functionality into something Android 8 can understand. As a result, he app will be bigger, it will run more slowly on Android 8 devices, and developers may have to add additional code to support Android 8.

Multiple Gradle configurations allow developers to support as many Android versions as they judge appropriate, all of them configured at a module level. For instance, in our case we have:

```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 29
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 24
        targetSdkVersion 29
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

This configuration determines that our app will be compiled using the 29th version of Android (Android 10) and should be compatible with any device running any version of Android between the 24th (Android 7.0) and the 29th. This means that our app will contain multiple compatibility layers to make Android 10 compatible with Android 7.0.

### Reference Repositories

Any time we reference external resources like dependencies in our project, Gradle must validate their existence and fetch them into our app. You also must configure Gradle with a list of  locations for these repositories, usually defined at a project-level.

In our example, we can have a look at `/build.gradle`:

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.41'
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()

    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.4.2'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
}
```

The *repositories{}* block in *buildscript {}* defines which repositories to check to satisfy the dependencies defined in the *buildscript { dependencies{} }* block. As we will soon learn, these dependencies are Gradle plugins.
The *repositories{}* block in *allprojects {}* defines which repositories to check to satisfy the dependencies defined in any of the modules of the project.

When multiple repositories are defined in the *repositories{}* block, Gradle will check them in the order defined. In our case, if both *google()* and *jcenter()* contain a copy of the same dependency, Gradle will first find the dependency in google() and never check *jcenter()*. Both copies should be exactly the same, but that has not always been the case. I recommend keeping *google()* at the top of the list of repositories.

### Gradle Plugins

You can extend the capabilities of the Gradle module by applying a plugin to it. For Android applications, plugins are generally applied in a module.
In our case, our `/app/build.gradle` applies three plugins to the *app* module:

```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android-extensions'

android {
    ...
}
```

The `com.android.application` plugin defines the module as an Android Application. This will instruct Gradle to compile our code into an apk and allow us to configure the build process using the *android{}* clause we see in the example.
The other two plugins instruct Gradle to compile the *app* module to enable Kotlin. Any Kotlin code will be compiled to *bytecode* and put into a *dex* file, exactly like Java code.

Plugins are a great way to extend the capabilities of our build process. With more plugins, we can:
Connect our apps to error-reporting services
Add a ribbon to the launcher icon of our app to identify each build-type
Use code-generation tools,
Add Gradle tasks that can automatically upload an apk to a distribution service
Automatically synchronize our localization files with different services, etc.
If you wonder whether a certain plugin exists, both GitHub and the official [Gradle Plugins portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/) are great resources to check.

### Build Types

Gradle allows you to build different versions of the same app using a single project. This is very useful when one version must be used by testers with more relaxed security settings, while one version will be released in the Play Store with premium features, and another, free version will be released in the Play Store with limited features.  In Android, these *versions* are called *variants* and are defined using *build* types.

Android projects always have a debug and a release type, defined by the Android plugin itself. Many developers customize their configuration to even add more build types.
In our example app, we can see how `/app/build.gradle` configures the *release* build type and defines a new build type called *blog* for the *app* module:

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.okta.oidcs"
        applicationIdSuffix ""
        ...
    }
    buildTypes {
        blog {
            ...
            applicationIdSuffix ".blog"
        }
        release {
            ...
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

This gives us the option to now choose between three *app* variants in Android Studio to compile/launch:

{% img blog/android-gradle/android-gradle-variants.jpg alt:"Android gradle variants" width:"500" %}{: .center-image }

The *defaultConfig{}* block defines configuration options that apply to all build types, unless the build type overwrites it with custom configuration.
For instance, the `application-id` of an app is the combination of *applicationId* and *applicationIdSuffix*. Given that the configuration for the debug variant doesn't define any of them, the application-id of the debug variant app will be `com.okta.oidcs.blog`. On the other hand, the configuration for the blog variant defines *applicationIdSuffix* ".blog", therefore, the application-id of the blog variant app will be `com.okta.oidcs.blog`.

### Manifest Placeholders

Dependencies often require certain parameters in the *AndroidManifest.xml* file, for each application module. Additionally, we often need to define different parameters for each build-type. Unfortunately, historical limitations introduced in the Android packaging (way before Gradle) mean there isn't a way around this.

As we previously discussed, Gradle manages manifest files and merges them if required, so it allows us to set the value of a property in the manifest configuration. The function of the *manifestPlaceholders{}* block is to define an array of property and values that will be set in the manifest when Gradle builds an app.

For instance, in our example we instruct Gradle to set the value of "appAuthRedirectScheme" in the manifest:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        manifestPlaceholders = [
                "appAuthRedirectScheme": "com.okta.example"
        ]
        ...
    }
}
```

### Add Dependencies in Gradle

Adding dependencies in Gradle is a very straightforward action. Just two things have to be taken into account:

1. Is the dependency a plugin or not?
2. Is the dependency provided by the repositories already defined?

If the dependency is a plugin, the required repository and dependency should be defined at a project level. In our case, as we did in */build.gradle*:

```gradle
buildscript {
    ...
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()

    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.4.2'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
        ...
    }
}
```

If the dependency is not a plugin, it should be defined at a module level as we did in our */app/build.gradle*:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    implementation 'com.okta.android:oidc-androidx:1.0.2'
    implementation 'com.okta.authn.sdk:okta-authn-sdk-api:1.0.0'
    implementation('com.okta.authn.sdk:okta-authn-sdk-impl:1.0.0') {
        exclude group: 'com.okta.sdk', module: 'okta-sdk-httpclient'
    }
    ...
```

There are multiple options to include module-level dependencies, based on the module-type, visibility, conflict-resolution, build-type-specificity, etc. It is worth going through the official [Android documentation on dependencies](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies) to learn more about it.

## What You Learned

You have discovered quite a bit through this article:

* We now understand how Gradle builds Android and how we can configure these steps
* We know the essential configuration options that will allow us to start integrating most third- party services
* We can confidently create multiple versions of our app, each with a configuration appropriate to our needs
