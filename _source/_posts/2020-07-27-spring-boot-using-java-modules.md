Java is one of the most mature and persistent development languages that exists. Recently, it shifted to a 6-month release schedule, enabling it to deliver more frequent updates to the language.
One of the changes introduced in Java 9 was the modular system.

The Java Platform Module System (JPMS) adds two fundamental capabilities when building Java apps:
- **Reliable configuration** - replacing the brittle, error-prone class-path mechanism with a means for program components to declare explicit dependencies upon one another.
- **Strong encapsulation** - allowing a component to declare which of its public types are accessible to other components and which are not.

Packages may be grouped into modules that serve as building blocks in the construction of very large programs. The declaration of a module specifies which other modules (packages,  classes, and interfaces) are required to compile and run code.

While we have the visibility modifiersâ€”public, private, protected, and _default_â€”they are not enough to provide external visibility. A common example used to illustrate the problem is a "Util" class, this class may be used throughout a library from various packages within a JAR file but is NOT meant to be used outside of the library. JPMS can help with this type of situation.

## Introduction 

When Java 9 was created, the JDK went under a major refactoring to modularize its content. It created various modules  to organize the contents.  Some examples include:  `java.base`, `java.sql`, and `java.xml`(along with many others). To date, there are a total of 60 modules in Java 14 JDK.

`java.base` has fundamental classes like `Object`, `String`, `Integer`, `Double`, etc. While `java.sql` has classes related to accessing the JDBC API like `ResultSet`, `Connection` and others. Additionally, `java.xml` has classes related to XML manipulation like `XMLStreamReader`, `XMLStreamWriter` and similar classes in that vein. 

The modularization enabled the possibility of reducing the Java runtime to include just the `java.base` if your application only depends on this module. By using the `jlink` tool that is bundled with the JDK, you can create a micro runtime with only the JDK modules you need. This post won't cover how to use `jlink`â€”as it is not the focusâ€”but you can see an example on this [Baeldung article](https://www.baeldung.com/jlink).

For the rest of this article, you should have at least some basic understanding of Spring Boot, Maven, and REST web services principles as well as Docker installed on your machine.

## Install a Java 9+ JDK

First, you'll need a Java 9+ JDK in order to use modules. If you have been using Java 8, you'll likely have to download a separate JDK with a version of 9 or later to be used for this tutorial. This project is set up to use JDK 11 in this tutorial. You can download the JDKs from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). Just make sure your JAVA_HOME environment variable is pointing to that JDK.

## Project Structure

In this article, we'll be covering how to develop a simple application with two modules: the `application` module (that contains the web-facing classes) and the `persistence` module (that contains the data access layer). We'll also be using a couple of dependencies (`spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` and `okta-spring-boot-starter`) to illustrate how they are configured when building a modular application.

The project source code can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/brunocleite/spring-boot-using-java-modules)

### How to Structure a Modular Project with Maven

We're going to create this project folder structure manually to better understand it. Each module will live inside a separate directory and have its own `pom.xml` file. There will also be a `pom.xml` on the project root that will serve as the parent pom for the modules.  Create the following folder structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pom.xml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main
â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ java
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ resources
â”œâ”€â”€ persistence
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ java
â””â”€â”€ pom.xml
```

First, let's define the root `pom.xml`. It contains the common `<parent>` indication to `spring-boot-started-parent` and two entries in the `<module>` section. These entries are the names of the directories for the modules we are developing. Please note that they are specific to Maven and denote sub-projects, having nothing to do with the Java modules that we'll be working on later.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <parent>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
        <version>2.3.1.RELEASE</version>
        <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
    </parent>
    <groupId>com.okta.developer</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-with-modules</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <packaging>pom</packaging>

    <properties>
    	<java.version>11</java.version>
    </properties>

    <modules>
        <module>application</module>
        <module>persistence</module>
    </modules>
</project>
```

The `persistence` module will have a `pom.xml` like the one below and point to the parent `pom.xml` that we defined earlier. This will have a dependency on `spring-data-mongo` since we'll be saving our data to a Mongo DB.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <parent>
        <groupId>com.okta.developer</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-with-modules</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </parent>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-with-modules-persistence</artifactId>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
```

Finally, the `application` module will have a `pom.xml` (below), pointing to the parent `pom.xml` (above). It will also have a dependency on `spring-boot-starter-web`â€” as we'll be creating REST endpoints on itâ€”and a dependency on our `persistence` module:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <parent>
        <groupId>com.okta.developer</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-with-modules</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </parent>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-with-modules-app</artifactId>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.okta.developer</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-with-modules-persistence</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>

</project>
```

To compile the project, run `mvn compile` from the project root.

**NOTE:** Don't confuse Maven modules with Java Modules. 

* **Maven modules** are used to separate a project into multiple sub-projects. The main project will have a `pom.xml` referencing sub-projects in the `<modules>` section. Each sub-project will have its own `pom.xml`. When building the main project, it will automatically build the sub-projects too.

* **Java modules** is another name for JPMS (Java Platform Module System), it was added in JDK 9 under the name Project Jigsaw. It allows applications (packaged as JAR or WAR) to define a `module-info.java`. This special module-info file contains a set of directives which define its dependencies and which classes are exported for use by other libraries. 

## Build an Application Without Java Modules

The presence of `module-info.java` in an application's source root defines that it is using Java modules. You will first build the application without JPMS and enable it in a later step.

### Create the Persistence Module

Create a class `Bird` in the persistence module in `persistence/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/animals/bird/Bird.java`. This will represent the entity that we'll be saving to DB. 

```java
package com.okta.developer.animals.bird;

import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

public class Bird {

    @Id
    private String id;

    private String specie;
    private String size;

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getSpecie() {
        return specie;
    }

    public void setSpecie(String specie) {
        this.specie = specie;
    }

    public String getSize() {
        return size;
    }

    public void setSize(String size) {
        this.size = size;
    }
}

```

Now we're going to create a repository to save this entity to DB. `Spring Data MongoDB` does this for us automatically, creating the CRUD operations so all we have to create is an interface extending MongoRepository.
Create this class in  `persistence/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/animals/bird/BirdRepository.java`:

```java
package com.okta.developer.animals.bird;

import org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.MongoRepository;

public interface BirdRepository extends MongoRepository<Bird, String> {
}
```

Finally, for the persistence module. We'll be creating a service class to expose the persistence operations in `persistence/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/animals/bird/BirdPersistence.java`:

```java
package com.okta.developer.animals.bird;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import java.util.List;

@Component
public class BirdPersistence {

    private BirdRepository birdRepository;

    @Autowired
    public BirdPersistence(BirdRepository birdRepository) {
        this.birdRepository = birdRepository;
    }

    @PostConstruct
    void postConstruct(){
        Bird sampleBird = new Bird();
        sampleBird.setSpecie("Hummingbird");
        sampleBird.setSize("small");
        save(sampleBird);
    }

    public void save(Bird bird) {
        birdRepository.save(bird);
    }

    public List<Bird> get() {
        return birdRepository.findAll();
    }
}

```

### Create the Web Application Module

In the application module, create the main application class `application/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/SpringBootModulesApplication.java` annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`:

```java
package com.okta.developer;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootModulesApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootModulesApplication.class, args);
    }
}

```

Add a controller to expose REST operations on the Bird classes
This class will be stored on `application/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/BirdController.java`

```java
package com.okta.developer;

import com.okta.developer.animals.bird.Bird;
import com.okta.developer.animals.bird.BirdPersistence;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.util.List;

@RestController
public class BirdController {

    private BirdPersistence birdPersistence;

    public BirdController(BirdPersistence birdPersistence) {
        this.birdPersistence = birdPersistence;
    }

    @GetMapping("bird")
    public List<Bird> getBird() {
        return birdPersistence.get();
    }

    @PostMapping("bird")
    public void saveBird(@RequestBody Bird bird) {
        birdPersistence.save(bird);
    }
}
```

At this point, the application is functional and can be run. Start a MongoDB instance using the following docker command:

```bash
docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo:3.6-xenial
```

Then, go to the project root and run:

```bash
mvn install && mvn spring-boot:run -pl application
```

If everything goes correctly, you'll be able to navigate to `http://localhost:8080/bird` and see a JSON output like this:

```json
[{"id":"5f03ff7277a08a55ae73c8b9","specie":"Hummingbird","size":"small"}]
```

## Secure Your Web Application

Before we move on to using Java modules, it's time to tune our app and make it secure by adding a single dependency and a couple configuration properties.

Add the following dependency to your `application/pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.okta.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>okta-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Register an Application on Okta

To begin, sign up for a [forever-free Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

Once you're signed into Okta, register your client application.

* In the top menu, click on **Applications**
* Select **Add Application**
* Click **Web** and then **Next**
* Enter `Spring Boot with Java Modules` as the **Name** (this value doesn't matter, so feel free to change it)
* Change the Login redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta`
* Click **Done**

### Configure the App with Okta Information

Create a file `application/src/main/resources/application.properties` with the following content:

```
okta.oauth2.issuer=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.clientId={clientId}
okta.oauth2.clientSecret={clientSecret} 
```

You can find {clientId} and {clientSecret} on the **General** tab of the Okta application you just crated:  

{% img blog/spring-boot-with-modules/okta-app.png alt:"Okta app setup" width:"542" %}{: .center-image }

You can find {yourOktaDomain} on your Okta dashboard:  

{% img blog/spring-boot-with-modules/org-url.png alt:"Okta Domain" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

If you restart the app and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/bird` in an incognito/private browser window, you'll see a login page.

## Using Java Modules

Now it is time to modularize the app. This is achieved by placing a file `module-info.java` in each project's source root (`src/main/java`). We'll be doing this for both our modules: `application` and `persistence`. There are two ways to modularize a Java appâ€”top-down and bottom-up. In this tutorial we'll be showing the bottom-up approach; modularizing the libraries before the app. This approach is preferable as we'll have `persistence` already modularized when writing the `application` and `module-info.java`. If `application` was modularized first then `persistence` would be treated as an automatic module and you would have to use the JAR file name for the module name.

### Modularize the `persistence` Library

Create a module declaration file `persistence/src/main/java/module-info.java` with the following content:

```java
module com.okta.developer.modules.persistence {

    requires java.annotation;
    requires spring.beans;
    requires spring.context;
    requires spring.data.commons;
    requires spring.data.mongodb;

    exports com.okta.developer.animals.bird;
}
```

Each `requires` keyword signalizes that this module will be depending on some other module.
Spring (version 5) is not modularized yet, its JAR files don't have the `module-info.java`. 
When you have a dependency on the `modulepath` (formerly the classpath for non-modular applications) like this they will be available as `automatic modules`.

An `automatic module` derives its name using a two-step process:
- If the JAR defines the `Automatic-Module-Name` header in its `MANIFEST.MF, then that property defines the module's name.
- Alternately, the JAR file name is used to determine the name.
The second approach is intrinsically unstable, so no modules with a dependency on such an automatic module should be published in public Maven repositories. 

In Spring 5, the `Automatic-Module-Name` metadata was added to all Spring  libraries, if/when Spring defines module-info, the metadata in your application does NOT need to change. 

The `exports` keyword exports all classes in that package. When another module uses a `requires` clause referencing that package, it will have access to the package classes. 

In this example, the module is exporting all classes under the `com.okta.developer.animals.bird` package.

### Modularize the `application` Project

Create a module declaration file `application/src/main/java/module-info.java` with the following content:

```java
module com.okta.developer.modules.app {

    requires com.okta.developer.modules.persistence;

    requires spring.web;
    requires spring.boot;
    requires spring.boot.autoconfigure;
}
```

This one is similar to the first but, along with the Spring dependencies, we also have the `com.okta.developer.modules.persistence` dependency.

By adding the `requires com.okta.developer.modules.persistence` this module will have access to the package that was exported: `com.okta.developer.animals.bird`.

## Running the Application

Go to the project root and run 
```bash
mvn install && mvn spring-boot:run -pl application
```

If everything is operating correctly you'll be able to login and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/bird` where you'll see JSON output.

## Learning More About Java Modular System 

The Java Modular System is an excellent addition to the Java ecosystem. It helps organize and isolate classes that were otherwise needlessly exposed. By looking at the application `module-info.java`, you can see a blueprint of the application dependencies. 

This topic is broad and, if you want to learn more, this [talk by Alex Buckley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22OW5t_Mbnk) is an excellent start. 

If you have an existing Spring Boot application that you'd like to have use the modular system, this other [talk by Jaap Coomans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxsCYxZ1gXU) will help you out.
