11ty is a fantastic tool for quickly creating static sites using a variety of templating languages. 11ty makes designing and developing static sites simple. It supports HTML, Markdown, JavaScript, Nunjucks, Handlebars, and many other template styles, along with built-in support for layouts, pagination, and slugify. 11ty aims to compete against other frameworks such as Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, Gatsby, and Nuxt. The framework is indeed as simple and powerful as its creators claim. 

This tutorial will teach how to secure your 11ty site using Okta. 11ty will produce static pages, which means you won't have the luxury of servers and states to help manage your authentication. But Okta still has a solution for this. To authenticate users, you will use the [Okta Sign-In Widget](https://developer.okta.com/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget/). Then you will store the `id token` returned from the Okta authentication server. You can then use that `id token` to query Okta's servers for many operations, including [verifying if the token is valid](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#introspect) or obtaining user information.

{% include toc.md %}

**Prerequisites:**

- [Node.js 10 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)

## Create your Okta application

{% include setup/cli.md type="spa" framework="Vue"
   loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080/callback" signup="false" %}

## Create your 11ty site

If you wish to follow along using the completed project you can [check out the GitHub repository here](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-website-eleventy-example).  

The first step is to create your 11ty site. Create your project directory.

```console
mkdir okta-website-eleventy-example
cd okta-website-eleventy-example
```

Next, create your node application and install 11ty.

```console
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev @11ty/eleventy@1.0.0
```

At this point, your 11ty site is ready to run. You can test it out by adding a new page.

```console
echo '<!doctype html><html><head><title>Page title</title></head><body><p>Hello World</p></body></html>' > index.html
```

Enter the following command to start 11ty:

```console
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

By default, 11ty will attempt to use port `8080` on localhost, so navigate to `http://localhost:8080`, and you can see your **Hello World** page.  

**NOTE:** If you are using Windows, you will need to open the index file you just created and resave it with `UTF-8` encoding, as 11ty uses `UTF-16 LE` by default.  

## Add a couple of static pages

Now you can add some content to your site. Your site will consist of the following pages:

 - An index page to greet users (`index.html`)
 - A login page (`login.html`)
 - A readme to demonstrate the usage of markdown (`README.md`)
 - A page that is under authentication (`protected.html`)

First, open the `index.html` file you just created and replace the code with the following.

```html
---
layout: _layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js
---

<div class="row align-items-md-stretch">
    <div class="col-md-12">
        <div class="h-100 p-5 text-white bg-secondary rounded-3">
            <h2>Using Okta with 11ty</h2>
            <p>A small tutorial on writing static sites with 
                <a class="text-dark" href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">11ty</a>, 
                secured by <a class="text-dark" href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank">Okta</a>
                written by <a class="text-dark" href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com/" target="_blank">Nik Fisher.</a>
            </p>
            <a class="btn btn-outline-light" role="button" href="Login">Login Now</a>
            <a class="btn btn-light" role="button" href="README">README</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

You will notice the `layout` variable at the top of the file. You have not added this file to your project yet and will need to do that. But you can assign the layout page to this file, so you don't have to add it later.

Next, create a file for `login.html` and add the following code.

```html
---
layout: _layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js
---

<div id="okta-login-container"></div>
<script>
  oktaSignIn.authClient.token.getUserInfo().then(function(user) {
    window.location='/protected';
  },function(error) {
    oktaSignIn.showSignInToGetTokens({
      el: '#okta-login-container'
    }).then(function(tokens) {
      oktaSignIn.authClient.tokenManager.setTokens(tokens);
      oktaSignIn.remove();
      window.location='/protected';
    }).catch(function(err) {
      console.error(err);
    });
  });
</script>
```

The only HTML in this page here is a `div` with `id="okta-login-container"`. You call the `OktaSignIn` features and display the login screen to the user with the JavaScript code on this page. Okta will create the login form and handle the actual authentication. All you need to do is call the `showSignInToGetTokens` method and handle the promise to set the token using the `tokenManager`. Once you have done that, you will redirect the user to the `protected` page. 

You can add the `protected.html` page now. Add the following code to it.

```html
---
layout: _layout_authenticated.11ty.js
---

<div id="content"></div>

<script>
    function loadPage(){
        //replace with API call 
        document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = "<h2>Congrats</h2><h5>You've reached a protected page</h5>"
    }
</script>
```

Since you haven't seen the `_layout_authenticated.11ty.js` page yet, this will need some explanation. After verifying that the user has authenticated, the `loadPage` function is called by the layout.  

There's a comment to replace the code here with an API call. You can add an API call to verify the ID token on the server-side before displaying any content to the user.

Finally, add a page for `README.md` and add the following markdown to it.

```markdown
---
layout: _layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js

# Okta Eleventy website example

This repository shows you how to use Okta on a static site built with 11ty.

**Prerequisites:**

- [Node.js 10 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)
```

The `README.md`you've just added is a truncated version of the [README file](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-website-eleventy-example/blob/master/README.md) that you can see in the GitHub repository for this project.

## Add layout pages

It's now time to add the layout pages for your static files. 11ty enables you to write layouts in several templating languages. For this project, you will use the stock `11ty.js` format. Create a new folder called `_includes` using the command `mkdir _includes`. 

Add a file called `_layout_base.11ty.js` and add the following code to it.

{% raw %}
```javascript
exports.data = {

};

exports.render = function (data) {
  return `<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
        integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
        integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p"
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/5.14.1/js/okta-sign-in.min.js"
        type="text/javascript"></script>
    <link href="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/5.14.1/css/okta-sign-in.min.css" type="text/css"
        rel="stylesheet" />
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>${data.title}</title>
</head>

<body>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        const oktaSignIn=new OktaSignIn({
            baseUrl: "https://{{yourOktaDomain}}",
            redirectUri: 'http://localhost:8080/callback',
            clientId: "{{yourClientId}}",
            authParams: {
                issuer: "https://{{yourOktaDomain}}/oauth2/default"
            }
        });     
    </script>
    <div class="container">
        ${data.content}
    </div>

</body>

</html>`;
};
```
{% endraw %}

Be sure to replace the placeholder variables with your actual Okta information.

This file will be the base layout for all of your pages.  It loads `bootstrap` into all of your pages and also initializes the `OktaSignIn` widget on each page.  In this way, you can access it in the JavaScript of your file no matter where you are.

Next, add a file for `_layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js` and then add the following code.

```javascript
exports.data = {
  title: "11ty And Okta",
  layout:  "_layout_base.11ty.js"
};

exports.render = function (data) {
  return `
     <header class="d-flex flex-wrap align-items-center justify-content-center justify-content-md-between py-3 mb-4 border-bottom">
      <a href="/" class="d-flex align-items-center col-md-3 mb-2 mb-md-0 text-dark text-decoration-none">
       Home
      </a>

      <div class="col-md-3 text-end">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary me-2"><a href="Login">Login</a></button>
      </div>
    </header>

    ${data.content}
        
        `;
};
```

This file extends the base layout you created by creating a header with a `Home` button and a `Login` button that will direct the user to the `Login` page with your Okta sign-in widget.

Finally, add a new file called `_layout_authenticated.11ty.js`. Then, add the following code.

```javascript
exports.data = {
title: "11ty And Okta",
layout: "_layout_base.11ty.js",
};

exports.render = function (data) {
return `

<header
    class="d-flex flex-wrap align-items-center justify-content-center justify-content-md-between py-3 mb-4 border-bottom">
    <a href="/" class="d-flex align-items-center col-md-3 mb-2 mb-md-0 text-dark text-decoration-none">
        Home
    </a>

    <div class="col-md-3 text-end">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary me-2" onclick='logout()'>Logout</button>
    </div>
</header>

${data.content}

<script type="text/javascript">
    function logout() {
        oktaSignIn.authClient.signOut();
        location.reload();
    }

    if(!oktaSignIn?.authClient?.token) {
        window.location='/Login';
    }

    oktaSignIn.authClient.token.getUserInfo().then(function(user) {
        if(loadPage) {
            loadPage();
        }
    }).catch(function(e) {
        console.log(e);
        window.location='/Login'
    });
</script>
`;
};
```

Again, this file will extend the base layout, while adding some additional functionality to each page that uses this layout. When the page loads, it will attempt to contact the Okta authorization server for information about the user with the ID token stored in the browser. If the contact request is successful, it will call the `loadPage` function implemented in those pages. Otherwise, the code redirects the user to the `Login` page. This page also contains a header with a `Logout` button and a method for `logout` that uses the sign-in widget to log the user out.

## Start your 11ty website

If you are still running the site, then 11ty will have hot reloaded the site, and you should see the home page. If not, run the following command:

```console
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

The command will build your templates into static pages and then serve the site on `localhost:8080`. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the home page.

{% img blog/build-website-with-eleventy/home-page.png alt:"Home Page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, click the login button to see the Okta Sign-In Widget in action. You can log in with your Okta credentials.

{% img blog/build-website-with-eleventy/login-page.png alt:"Login Page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

If everything goes well, you should see the protected page.
