The Okta CLI is a new tool we've created here at Okta. It's designed to streamline creating new Okta accounts, registering apps, and getting started. Wwwhhaaattt, you might say?! That's right, it's super awesome!

To show you how easy it is, I https://youtu.be/aMmTcLnoZzc[created a screencast that shows you how to use it with Angular].

</div>

IMPORTANT: To create the same app as the one shown in this video, you'll need to run `okta start angular --branch widget`.

For those that would rather read than watch—this is for you.

== Install the Okta CLI

You can find the website for the Okta CLI at https://cli.okta.com/[cli.okta.com]. This site has instructions on how to use common package managers on macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also use cURL:

[source,shell]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okta/okta-cli/master/cli/src/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
----

Once you have the Okta CLI installed, you'll need https://nodejs.org/[Node.js installed] to build your Angular app. I used v14.15.0 in this screencast.

== Create an Angular App

To create a secure Angular app with Okta, run `okta start angular`. You'll need to verify your email and set a password as part of this.

TIP: If you already have an Okta account, you can run `okta login` first.

This command will download our https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-angular-sample[Okta Angular sample], register your app on Okta, and configure it by creating a `.okta.env` file with your issuer and client ID.

Follow the instructions that are printed out for you. To summarize:

[source,shell]
----
cd angular
npm install
npm start
----

Next, open your browser to `http://localhost:4200` in an incognito window. You will see a screen like the following:

Click **Login** and authenticate with your credentials.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/okta-cli-angular/login.png' %}[alt=Angular Login,width=800,align=center]

Upon successful sign-in, you'll be returned to your app. Click on **Profile** to see your data that's retrieved from your ID token.

[source,typescript]
----
export class ProfileComponent implements OnInit {
  claims!: { name: string; value: unknown }[];

  constructor(@Inject(OKTA_AUTH) public oktaAuth: OktaAuth) {
  }

  async ngOnInit() {
    const idToken = await this.oktaAuth.tokenManager.get('idToken');
    this.claims = Object.entries(idToken.claims).map(entry => ({ name: entry[0], value: entry[1] }));
  }

}
