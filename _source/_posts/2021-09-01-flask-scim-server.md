At a very high level, the SCIM (System for Cross-Identity Management) protocol exists to provision and sync users and groups across various, independent systems. There is some room for nuance in the [SCIM spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644). In this post we will take a look at some basic SCIM operations. We'll peek under the hood at the flow between Okta and a SCIM server built in Flask using PostgreSQL as our app database. Even if you're not a Python dev, hopefully you can take away some of the concepts in this guide for your own SCIM implementation.

### What You'll Need

- [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

### Setting Up the Flask Server and Postgres DB 
{% img blog/flask-scim-server/flask_postgres.png alt:"PostgreSQL and Flask Logos Image" width:"500" %}

1.  Clone the repo found [here](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-scim-flask-example), open terminal and `cd` into the project root.
2.  Create a new virtualenv in the root folder with `virtualenv env`.
3.  Run the virtual environment with `source env/bin/activate`.
4.  Install necessary Python packages with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
5.  Install [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
6.  Create a new Postgres database named `scim`. Enter the `psql` shell by opening a new terminal tab and typing `psql postgres`. Create the DB with `CREATE DATABASE scim;` (Run `\list` to double-check the database has been created).
7.  Go back to the terminal tab that is in the flask app root. Run the following commands to create migrations and tables in the `scim` database:
    - `python manage.py db init`
    - `python manage.py db migrate`
    - `python manage.py db upgrade`
    
    > Feel free to hop back to your Postgres tab and run `\c scim` to navigate into the scim db, then `\dt` to see your new tables: `groups`, `users`, `link`. (`link` is a table facilitating the many-to-many relationship between users and groups.)

8. Everything should be set up now to run the server locally. Finally, run `python app.py` to do so. You should now have your SCIM server running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Set Up Ngrok to Route Requests From Okta to Localhost


Once you have ngrok installed, run `./ngrok http 5000` to create a tunnel from ngrok to your `http://localhost:5000`. Copy the `https` Forwarding URL created by ngrok as you will need it later.

{% img blog/flask-scim-server/ngrok_url.png alt:"ngrok forwarding URL" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

### Creating and Configuring Your Okta Application


Now it's time to create a new SCIM integration in Okta. If your SCIM app(s) are already set up on the Okta side, feel free to skip ahead to [**Test the SCIM Server**](#test-the-scim-server). There are two options that will work with this server, and I will ALWAYS recommend the first, which is to use an Okta SCIM template application.

#### Option 1: SCIM Template App

1. In your Okta dashboard, go to **Applications** -> **Applications**, then click the **Browse App Catalogue** button. Search for **SCIM 2.0 Test App (Header Auth)** and click the **Add** button once you have it pulled up.
2. In the **General Settings** tab, click **Next**.
3. We will set this up as a SWA application, so in the **Sign-On Options** tab, click **Secure Web Authentication**.
4. Click **Done**.
5. Tab over to **Provisioning** and click **Configure API Integration.**
6. Check **Enable API integration**.
7. In the Base URL field, paste in the ngrok url you generated above with **/scim/v2** appended to the end. In the API Token field, type **Bearer 123456789**. (Later on we will go over how to customize this auth header, but out-of-the-box, the SCIM server expects this value.)
8. Click **Test API Credentials** and you should get a success message like the below:

    {% img blog/flask-scim-server/scim_1.png alt:"Test Api Credentials UI Image" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

    > You can check the ngrok logs by navigating to `http://localhost:4040` to see the request from Okta as well as the response from the SCIM server.

    {% img blog/flask-scim-server/scim_2.png alt:"Test Api Credentials Call Image" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

9. Click **Save**. Now your **Provisoning** tab will look a bit different.

10. Click **Edit** next to **Provisioning to App** and check off:
    - **Create Users**
    - **Update User Attributes**
    - **Deactivate Users**
    
And **Save**.

{% img blog/flask-scim-server/scim_3.png alt:"Provisioning Settings Image" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

#### Option 2: Enable SCIM Provisioning for Existing App Integration Wizard (AIW) App

> Feel free to skip over this section to **Test the SCIM Server** if you set up your SCIM integration above.

1. In your Okta dashboard, go to **Applications** -> **Applications**, then click the **Create App Integration** button. For this setup we will select **SWA - Secure Web Authentication**. Click **Next**.
2. You can put whatever you'd like for the **App Name** and **App Login Page URL**, as we will just be loking at the SCIM functionality and not the SWA aspect of this app. Click **Finish**.
3. In the **General** tab of the app, click **Edit** and toggle Provisioning from **None** to **SCIM**. Click **Save**.
4. Your app should now have a **Provisioning** tab. Tab over to it and fill out the integration settings to match those in the image below. Make the Authorization header **123456789**. You can change this later in the SCIM flask app.

    {% img blog/flask-scim-server/scim_4.png alt:"AIW SCIM Settings Image" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

5. Click **Test Connector Configuration** and you should see the following success confirmation:

    {% img blog/flask-scim-server/scim_5.png alt:"Test Connector Configuration UI Image" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

6. You can now click **Save**.

    > You can navigate to `http://localhost:4040` to see the request from Okta on this request, as well as the response from the SCIM server.

    {% img blog/flask-scim-server/scim_6.png alt:"Test Connector Configuration Call Image" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }


7. Now your **Provisoning** tab will look a bit different. Click **Edit** next to **Provisioning to App** and check off:
    - Create Users
    - Update User Attributes
    - Deactivate Users
    
And **Save**.

{% img blog/flask-scim-server/scim_7.png alt:"AIW Provisioning Settings Image" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

You should now be set on the Okta side to start testing the SCIM server.

{% img blog/flask-scim-server/frodo.webp alt:"AIW Provisioning Settings Image" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

### What Did We Just Do?

Before we go ahead and test our SCIM server, let's talk a bit about what we did in the setup steps above. Essentially we set up the following 3 components:

{% img blog/flask-scim-server/flow_1.png alt:"SCIM FLow IMage" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

In this setup, Okta is the source of truth for user data. The SCIM server opens up four endpoints locally, which Okta is able to access thanks to the routing capabilities of ngrok. These endpoints are:

- `https://localhost:5000/scim/v2/Users`
- `https://localhost:5000/scim/v2/Users/{user_id}`
- `https://localhost:5000/scim/v2/Groups`
- `https://localhost:5000/scim/v2/Groups/{group_id}`


These endpoints trigger [CRUD operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) based off the requests from Okta. Some examples of these calls:

#### CREATE

Okta Examples:

- When a user is assigned to the Okta app, Okta will make a `POST` to `/scim/v2/Users`
- When a group is assigned to the Okta app, Okta will make iterative `POST`s to `/scim/v2/Users` with each member of the group
- When using Push Groups to add a new group to the Okta app, Okta sends a `POST` to `/scim/v2/Groups`

#### READ

Okta Examples:

- When importing users & groups from the external app Okta sends a `GET` to `/scim/v2/Users` and/or `GET` to `/scim/v2/Groups`
- When getting all (or filtered) users from the external app, Okta sends a `GET` to `/scim/v2/Users`
- When getting a sole user from the external app, Okta sends a `GET` to `/scim/v2/Users/{user_id}`
- When getting all (or filtered) groups from the external app, Okta sends a`GET` to `/scim/v2/Groups`
- When getting a sole group from the external app, Okta sends a`GET` to `/scim/v2/Groups/{group_id}`

> With the exception of import, these actions are initiated by Okta prior to a CREATE, UPDATE or DELETE action. You can think of these calls as a sync verification step.

#### UPDATE

Okta Examples:

- When updating user attributes in Okta, Okta sends a `PUT` or `PATCH` to `/scim/v2/Users/{user_id}`
- When assigning or unassigning a user that already exists in external app DB, Okta sends a `PUT` or `PATCH` to `/scim/v2/Users/{user_id}`
- When changing membership of a pushed Okta group, Okta sends a `PUT` or `PATCH` to `/scim/v2/Groups/{group_id}`

#### DELETE

Okta Examples:

- When selecting "Delete the group in target app" after selecting "Unlink pushed group" in the **Push Groups** tab, okta sends a `DELETE` to `/scim/v2/Groups/{group_id}`

Let's move on to testing the SCIM server to see some of these calls in action!

<a name="test-the-scim-server"/>
### Test the SCIM Server
>**Note**: I am using the SCIM template integration in the steps below. If you are using the AIW version, there may be subtle differences in some of the calls. More info [here](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/scim/scim-20/).

- Navigate to `http://localhost:4040` to see all the requests and responses taking place between Okta and the SCIM server. I will be truncating mine a bit in the examples below for brevity.

- From the section above, you saw that we set up our SCIM integration with **Bearer 123456789** in the authorization header. You can change this header to whatever you'd like in the **app.py** file at the following line of function **auth_required**:

`if request.headers['Authorization'].split('Bearer ')[1] == '123456789':`

Replace 123456789 with whatever unique value you'd like and make sure to update this in the provisioning tab of your Okta integrations.

>**Note**: This is just for convenience in testing - NEVER store sensitive credentials in source code. More info [here](https://developer.okta.com/books/api-security/api-keys/keep-keys-private/#api-keys-keep-keys-private).

>Authentication exists to protect your endpoints from unwanted requests. In this guide we set up header authorization, but you can also use basic auth or OAuth. This tutorial doesn't delve too deeply into this aspect of SCIM.

#### Assign a User
Under the **Assignments** tab, click **Assign** -> **Assign to People**. I assigned user **obi-wan.kenobi@iamciam.dev**. Here is a look at the requests and responses from Okta to my SCIM server:

 - *Okta Request:*

```
GET /scim/v2/Users?filter=userName%20eq%20%22obi-wan.kenobi%40iamciam.dev%22&startIndex=1&count=100
```

>Okta will first run a GET with a userName filter query parameter to see if the user already exists in the external app, since no external ID for the user yet exists to link them to the Okta user.

 - *SCIM Server Response:*

```http
200 OK
```

```json
{
    "Resources": [],
    "itemsPerPage": 0,
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"
    ],
    "startIndex": 1,
    "totalResults": 0
}
```

>This response tells Okta that the user does not currently exist in the database and thus informs the next call - a `POST` to create the user.

 - *Okta Request:*

```http
POST /scim/v2/Users
```

```http
{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
    ],
    "userName": "obi-wan.kenobi@iamciam.dev",
    "name": {
        "givenName": "Obi-Wan",
        "familyName": "Kenobi"
    },
    "emails": [
        {
            "primary": true,
            "value": "obi-wan.kenobi@iamciam.dev",
            "type": "work"
        }
    ],
    "displayName": "Obi-Wan Kenobi",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "externalId": "00use6vjvehodmsQb4x6",
    "groups": [],
    "password": "gl^m&qWZ",
    "active": true
}
```

>**Note**: The above password value is randomly generated by Okta as many external apps require this value on user creation. As the app is federated, this password cannot be used to login.

 - *SCIM Server Response:*

```http
201 CREATED
```

```json
{
    "active": true,
    "displayName": "Obi-Wan Kenobi",
    "emails": [
        {
            "primary": true,
            "type": "work",
            "value": "obi-wan.kenobi@iamciam.dev"
        }
    ],
    "externalId": "00use6vjvehodmsQb4x6",
    "groups": [],
    "id": "289383d9-ff3a-48bb-99ea-3048762267c7",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "meta": {
        "resourceType": "User"
    },
    "name": {
        "familyName": "Kenobi",
        "givenName": "Obi-Wan",
        "middleName": null
    },
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
    ],
    "userName": "obi-wan.kenobi@iamciam.dev"
}
```

- Now If you navigate to your local **scim** database and run `select * from users;`, you should see the assigned user in the database.

{% img blog/flask-scim-server/scim_8.png alt:"Database New User Image" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

#### Unassign a User

Let's go ahead and unassign the user we just assigned in Okta. Under **Assignments**, click the **X** next to the user we just assigned:

{% img blog/flask-scim-server/scim_9.png alt:"UI Unassign User Image" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

The request/response should look like this:
 - *Okta Request:*

```http
PATCH /scim/v2/Users/289383d9-ff3a-48bb-99ea-3048762267c7
```

```json
{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"
    ],
    "Operations": [
        {
            "op": "replace",
            "value": {
                "active": false
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

> Okta does not delete an unassigned user but rather updates their `active` value to `false`.

 - *SCIM Server Response:*

```http
204 NO CONTENT
```

- And sure enough, if you run that same `select * from users;` in the scim db, you will see the user is now `active: false`:

{% img blog/flask-scim-server/scim_10.png alt:"Database Inactive User Image" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

#### Assign a Group
Under the **Assignments** tab, click **Assign** -> **Assign to Groups**. I assigned group **Droids**. Note that this behavior is similar to the way individual users were assigned above. Okta will iterate through the group membership and create the users in the external SCIM server - but the Group itself won't be made. That is done in **Push Groups**, which we will handle later. Here is a look at the requests and responses from Okta to the SCIM server:

 - *Okta Request:*

```http
GET /scim/v2/Users?filter=userName%20eq%20%22c-3po%40iamciam.dev%22&startIndex=1&count=100
```

 - *SCIM Server Response:*

```http
200 OK
```

```json
{
    "Resources": [],
    "itemsPerPage": 0,
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"
    ],
    "startIndex": 1,
    "totalResults": 0
}
```

 - *Okta Request:*

```http
POST /scim/v2/Users
```

```json
{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
    ],
    "userName": "c-3po@iamciam.dev",
    "name": {
        "givenName": "C",
        "familyName": "3PO"
    },
    "emails": [
        {
            "primary": true,
            "value": "c-3po@iamciam.dev",
            "type": "work"
        }
    ],
    "displayName": "C 3PO",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "externalId": "00usemeo53HWWPYy14x6",
    "groups": [],
    "password": "wA&&cprB",
    "active": true
}
```

 - *SCIM Server Response:*

```http
201 CREATED
```

```json
{
    "active": true,
    "displayName": "C 3PO",
    "emails": [
        {
            "primary": true,
            "type": "work",
            "value": "c-3po@iamciam.dev"
        }
    ],
    "externalId": "00usemeo53HWWPYy14x6",
    "groups": [],
    "id": "478c4cf4-1aa3-41a1-93da-4c154c5955e0",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "meta": {
        "resourceType": "User"
    },
    "name": {
        "familyName": "3PO",
        "givenName": "C",
        "middleName": null
    },
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
    ],
    "userName": "c-3po@iamciam.dev"
}
```

- There are 3 members in my **Droids** group: C-3P0, R2-D2, and BB-8. The above req/resp chain repeats for the other 2 users. Now when I run `select * from users;` in the scim database I can see the assigned users:

{% img blog/flask-scim-server/scim_11.png alt:"Database Assigned Users Image" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

#### Push Groups

As mentioned above, assigning a group in Okta only adds the users to my SCIM server, not the Group itself. **Push Groups** is an Okta-specific functionality. It gives you the granularity to assign Okta group members to a SCIM application without automatically adding that group to the external app. More info can be found [here](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-about-group-push.htm) In order to add a Group to our external app, tab over to **Push Groups** in your Okta app integration. Click **Push Groups** -> **Find groups by name** and select the group you assigned above. Make sure **Push group memberships immediately** is checked and click **Save**. Two calls should be made by Okta - one creating the group itself and another updating the group membership. Here are the requests and responses for my Droids group push:

 - *Okta Request:*

```http
POST /scim/v2/Groups
```

```json
{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group"
    ],
    "displayName": "Droids",
    "members": [
        {
            "value": "cc2573a1-e1c4-491d-a3db-ae4a2e078d61",
            "display": "bb-8@iamciam.dev"
        },
        {
            "value": "478c4cf4-1aa3-41a1-93da-4c154c5955e0",
            "display": "c-3po@iamciam.dev"
        },
        {
            "value": "34e14e58-f0fe-4e9d-aeb2-0da25fa6626d",
            "display": "r2-d2@iamciam.dev"
        }
    ]
 }

 - *SCIM Server Response:*

                },
                {

                    "display": "c-3po@iamciam.dev"
                },
                {
                    "value": "34e14e58-f0fe-4e9d-aeb2-0da25fa6626d",
                    "display": "r2-d2@iamciam.dev"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

 - *SCIM Server Response:*

 ```http
 200 OK
 ```
 
 ```json
 {
    "displayName": "Droids",
    "id": "b446521a-a65b-4c0b-a5ee-0a15e8e3e908",
    "members": [
        {
            "display": "c-3po@iamciam.dev",
            "value": "478c4cf4-1aa3-41a1-93da-4c154c5955e0"
        },
        {
            "display": "bb-8@iamciam.dev",
            "value": "cc2573a1-e1c4-491d-a3db-ae4a2e078d61"
        },
        {
            "display": "r2-d2@iamciam.dev",
            "value": "34e14e58-f0fe-4e9d-aeb2-0da25fa6626d"
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "resourceType": "Group"
    },
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group"
    ]
 }
