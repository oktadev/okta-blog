React.js is one of the most popular front-end javascript frameworks today.  For most of its life, React has connected to REST APIs to fetch or save data on a server.  GraphQL is a query language that aims to replace REST APIs by providing consumers with a clear description of the data in the API.  By combining these two technologies, you can quickly connect to an API with your React.js application.  There are many packages available for connecting to a GraphQL API.  One of the most popular is Apollo, however you can also use Axios, or even the built-in JavaScript `fetch` function.  For this application, you will use Axios, but I encourage you to check out Apollo or any other GraphQL/React packages available.

To secure your application, you will be using Okta's single sign-on provider.  Okta provides a great set of tools to make integrating its service into a React application as simple as installing an npm package.   

In React, you will learn to build an application using the public GraphQL API provided by [Everbase](https://www.everbase.co/editor).  The data in this API contains some information regarding exchange rates in various currencies, as well as information about countries in which those currencies are used.  For this application, you will allow the user to convert his/hermoney into another currency.  Then you will show the user some information about what countries accept that currency.  

## Set Up GraphQL Server as a Service

The first thing you need to do is sign up for an Everbase account and option an API Key.  This can be done on the [API Keys](https://www.everbase.co/account/keys) section of their site.  You can log in with your GitHub account or create an account on their site.  

## Set Up Authentication for Your React Application

Next, you will need to set up a new Okta Application from your account administration page.  Log in to your developer's console and click **Applications**, and then click **Add Application**.  In the *Create New Application* section on the next page, select *Single Page App* and click **Next**.  On the *Application Settings* page, give your application a meaningful name.  I named mine *Exchange Rates*, but you can call yours whatever you want.  Because React will launch on port 3000, by default, you will want to change your URLs to `localhost:3000`.  Then click done.

{% img blog/quick-graphql-react-app/okta-app-settings.png alt:"Okta App Settings" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

Make note of your *Client ID* on the *General Settings* tab as you will need it in your application.

## Scaffold Your React Application

Next, you can start to frame out your web application.  To start, access the *create-react-app* toolchain with the command `npx create-react-app exchange-rates` in the terminal.  This will take a minute, so now is the perfect time for a coffee break!  Once the command has finished running, you can start to install your packages for the application.

First, you will use bootstrap for the HTML framework.  To make bootstrap easier to use with React, you will also include the react-bootstrap package.

```console
npm i bootstrap@4.5.0
npm i react-bootstrap@1.0.1
```

As mentioned before, you will use the promise based Axios for your HTTP client.

```console
npm i axios@0.19.2
```

Dotenv will store your environment variables.  You can add the `.env` file to your gitignore for security.

```console
npm i dotenv@8.2.0
```

React-router-dom will provide some functionality for adding routes to your application, including the secure routes you will set up under authentication.

```console
npm i react-router-dom@5.2.0
```

Finally, you will need to install the necessary Okta-React packages to make integration to Okta as easy as possible.

```console
npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@3.0.0
npm i @okta/okta-react@3.0.1
npm i @okta/okta-signin-widget@4.1.0
```

## Build Your GraphQL React Application

First, you can add a file to the root of your application named `.env`.  Add the following code to it:

```properties
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourOktaClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE={yourOktaDomain}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_EVERBASE_API_KEY={yourEverbaseApiKey}
```

Here you have your necessary Okta information and your Okta Application Setup, along with your Everbase API Key.  

### App With Router Access and App.js

In your `src` directory, add a new file called `AppWithRouterAccess.jsx`.  Add the following code to it:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Route, useHistory, } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Security, SecureRoute, LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';

import ExchangeRates from './Pages/ExchangeRate'
import Home from './Pages/Home'
import Login from './Pages/Login'

const AppWithRouterAccess = () => {
  const history = useHistory();
  const onAuthRequired = () => {
      history.push('/login');
  };

  const baseDomain = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE;
  const issuer = baseDomain + '/oauth2/default'
  const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
  const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + '/implicit/callback';

  const loggedIn = true;

  return (
    <Security issuer={issuer}
        clientId={clientId}
        redirectUri={redirect}
        onAuthRequired={onAuthRequired}
        pkce={true} >
        <Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home} />
        <SecureRoute path='/ExchangeRates' component={ExchangeRates} />
        <Route path='/login' render={() => <Login baseUrl={baseDomain} issuer={issuer} />} />
        <Route path='/implicit/callback' component={LoginCallback} />
    </Security>
  );
};

export default AppWithRouterAccess;
```

The primary job of this file is to define the routes in your application.  This file is also where you will set up your Okta client and integrate it into your application.  You will notice the `ExchangeRates` route is defined as `SecureRoute`.  This way, the application will enforce authentication on that route.  You also need to define a route for `/implicit/callback` to ensure that Okta's login redirect URI has a place to land.  

Next, you will need to update your `App.js` page with some custom code to replace the boilerplate from create-react-app.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import AppWithRouterAccess from './AppWithRouterAccess';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <AppWithRouterAccess/>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This code will tell your application to use your new `AppWithRouterAccess` page.  You are also importing bootstrap here, as react-bootstrap requires the CSS to be imported.  This only needs to be imported once.  

### Header Component

Add a new folder to the `src` directory called `Components`.  Add a file called `Header.jsx` to this folder and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { Navbar, Nav, Form, Button } from 'react-bootstrap'

const Header = () => {
  const { authState, authService } = useOktaAuth();

  if (authState.isPending) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  const button = authState.isAuthenticated ?
    <Button variant="secondary" onClick={() => { authService.logout() }}>Logout</Button> :
    <Button variant="secondary" onClick={() => { authService.login() }}>Login</Button>

  return (
    <Navbar bg="light" expand="lg">
      <Navbar.Brand href="/">Lets Escape</Navbar.Brand>
      <Navbar.Toggle aria-controls="basic-navbar-nav" />
      <Navbar.Collapse id="basic-navbar-nav">
        <Nav className="mr-auto">
          <Nav.Link href="/">Home</Nav.Link>
          <Nav.Link href="/ExchangeRates">Exchange Currency</Nav.Link>
        </Nav>
        <Form inline>
          {button}
        </Form>
      </Navbar.Collapse>
    </Navbar>
  );
};

export default Header;
```

The header will be used on every page, which is why you create it as a component.  The component itself is fairly simple.  There are a couple navigation links to the pages you will implement shortly.  There is also a button that will change between Login or Logout, depending on the authentication status of the user.  

### Home Page

Next, you will provide a short landing page for users entering the site.  Add a new folder called `Pages` under the `src` directory, and add a file called `Home.jsx`.  Add the following code to that file:

{% raw %}
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Link, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
import Header from '../Components/Header'
import { Container, Row, Col, Card } from 'react-bootstrap'
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

const Home = () => {

  const { authState } = useOktaAuth();

  return (authState.isAuthenticated ?

    <Redirect to={{ pathname: '/ExchangeRates' }} /> :

    <Container>
      <Header></Header>
      <Row>
        <Col sm={12} className="text-center">
          <h3>Let's Escape</h3>
          <h4>Connect.  Exchange.  Move.</h4>
          <h5>A React Demo Use Okta and GraphGL</h5>
          <h5><a href="https://www.everbase.co/editor">GraphQL Data Available here</a></h5>
        </Col>
      </Row>
      <br></br>
      <Row >
        <Col sm={12} className="text-center">
          <Card style={{ width: '21.5em', margin: '0 auto' }}>
            <Card.Header>
              Already have an Okta Account?
            </Card.Header>
            <Card.Body>
              <Link to='/ExchangeRates'>Login Here</Link>
            </Card.Body>
          </Card>
        </Col>
      </Row>
    </Container>
  );
};

export default Home;
```
{% endraw %}

The one trick here is if the user is already authenticated, you will need to redirect that user to the `ExchangeRate` route defined earlier.

### Login Page and Login Form

The next step is to provide a login page for your users to use when they attempt to access the site.  First, add a new file to the `Components` folder called `LoginForm.jsx`.  The code is as follows:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import OktaAuth from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { Form, Button, Row, Col } from 'react-bootstrap'

const LoginForm = ({ baseUrl, issuer }) => {

  const { authService } = useOktaAuth();
  const [sessionToken, setSessionToken] = useState();
  const [username, setUsername] = useState();
  const [password, setPassword] = useState();

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({ url: baseUrl, issuer: issuer });
    oktaAuth.signIn({ username, password })
      .then(res => setSessionToken(res.sessionToken))
      .catch(err => console.log('Found an error', err));
  };

  const handleUsernameChange = (e) => {
    setUsername(e.target.value); 
  };

  const handlePasswordChange = (e) => {
    setPassword(e.target.value);
  };

  if (sessionToken) {
    authService.redirect({ sessionToken });
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <Row>
      <Col sm={3}>
        <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>

          <Form.Group controlId="username">
            <Form.Label>Username</Form.Label>
            <Form.Control type="text" placeholder="Enter Username" value={username} onChange={handleUsernameChange} />
          </Form.Group>

          <Form.Group controlId="password">
            <Form.Label>Password</Form.Label>
            <Form.Control type="password" placeholder="password" value={password} onChange={handlePasswordChange} />
          </Form.Group>

          <Button variant="primary" type="submit">
            Login
        </Button>

        </Form>
      </Col>
    </Row>
  );
};

export default LoginForm;
```

In this file, you are providing a simple login form to the user.  The trick is to override the submit function with the Okta logic.  If the user logs in successfully, you can set the session token and let the user continue.  

Next, add a new file in the `Pages` folder called `Login.jsx`.  

{% raw %}
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
import LoginForm from '../Components/LoginForm'
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { Container } from 'react-bootstrap'
import Header from '../Components/Header'

const Login = ({ baseUrl, issuer }) => {
  const { authState } = useOktaAuth();

  if (authState.isPending) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
  return authState.isAuthenticated ?
    <Redirect to={{ pathname: '/ExchangeRates' }} /> :

    <Container>
      <Header></Header>
      <br></br>
      <h4>Please Login with your Okta Account</h4>
      <LoginForm baseUrl={baseUrl} issuer={issuer} />
    </Container>;
};

export default Login;
```
{% endraw %}

Again, you are checking to see if the user is already logged in.  If they are, you can redirect them to the ExchangeRates page, otherwise present the Login Form.  

### Exchange Rate Page

The last step is to implement the ExchangeRate page itself.  In `Pages`, add a new file called `ExchangeRate.jsx`.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Header from '../Components/Header'
import { Container, Row, Col, Table, Form, Button } from 'react-bootstrap'
import axios from 'axios';

class ExchangeRates extends Component {

  constructor(props, context) {
    super(props, context);

    this.state = {
      loading: false,
      currencies: [],
      user: {
        username: 'nik',
        currentCurrencyIso: 'USD',
        currentAmount: 50.00,
        currentCurrency: {}
      },
      targetIso: 'AUD',
      targetAmount: 0.00,
      countries: []
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {

    this.setState({
        loading: true
    });

    var c = this.sendQuery(this.getCurrenciesQuery())
      .then(response => {
        var u = this.state.user;
        u.currentCurrency = response.data.data.currencies.filter(currency => currency.isoCode == this.state.user.currentCurrencyIso)[0];
        this.setState({
            currencies: response.data.data.currencies.filter(currency => currency.convert != null),
            loading: false,
            user: u
        });
        this.updateTarget('AUD');
      })
      .catch(err => {
        console.log(err);
      });
  }

  sendQuery(query, variables) {
    return axios.post('https://api.everbase.co/graphql?apikey=' +  process.env.REACT_APP_EVERBASE_API_KEY, {
      query
    });
  }

  getCurrenciesQuery() {

    return '{               \
      currencies            \
      {                     \
        id                  \
        isoCode             \
        name                \
        unitSymbols         \
        convert(to: "USD")  \
      }                     \
    }';
  }

  getCurrencyCountryQuery(isoCode) {
    return '{                                                   \
      currencies(where: {isoCode: {eq: "' + isoCode + '"}}) {   \
        countries {                                             \
          capitalName                                           \
          population                                            \
          name                                                  \
          vatRate                                               \
        }                                                       \
      }                                                         \
    }';
  }

  handleTargetChange(e) {
    var isoCode = e.target.value;
    this.updateTarget(isoCode);
  }

  updateTarget(isoCode) {
    var t = this.state.currencies.filter(c => c.isoCode === isoCode)[0];

    if (t) {
      var amt = this.state.user.currentAmount / t.convert;

      this.setState({
        targetIso: t.isoCode,
        targetAmount: amt.toFixed(2)
      });

      this.sendQuery(this.getCurrencyCountryQuery(t.isoCode))
        .then(resp => {
            this.setState({
                countries: resp.data.data.currencies[0].countries
            });
        })
    }
  }

  render() {

  if (this.state.loading) {
    return <Container>
      <Header></Header>
      <h4>Loading, please wait.</h4>
    </Container>
  }

  return (

                  <th>Vat Rate</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                {this.state.countries.map((country, i) => {
                  return (
                    <tr>
                      <td>{country.name}</td>
                      <td>{country.capitalName}</td>
                      <td>{country.population}</td>
                      <td>{country.vatRate}</td>
                    </tr>
                  )
                })}
              </tbody>
            </Table>
          </Col>
      </Row>
    </Container >
    );
  }
}

export default ExchangeRates;
```

Here you are presenting the user with an exchange rate calculator and some information about the countries in which the target currency is used.  

To populate the dropdown boxes the user will set, you will first need to grab the data from Everbase.  This is where you can use Axios to make a call to the Everbase server.  In this case, there are a couple helper methods to create the query and one for calling the Everbase server.  Since Axios is promise-based, you can use `then` rather than callbacks for processing the data that is returned.  First, you will obtain a list of currencies.  Here you are filtering the currencies to ensure that a conversion rate exists.   (Some of the currencies do not have a conversion to USD.)  Once you have that list, you can populate the dropdowns with them.  When the user changes the target drop down, the target amount is updated to reflect the exchange rate between the two currencies.  

The second task when the user changes the dropdown is to obtain some data about the currency from Everbase.  This data will include the countries that use the currency, their capitals, populations, and the VAT rate.  

## Test Your GraphQL React Application

All your code is complete and you can now test your application.  In the terminal, use `npm start` to kickoff your application.  You should be presented with the Home page upon navigating to `localhost:3000`.  Click on **Exchange Rates**, and you will be presented with the login page.  Enter your Okta credentials and explore the exchange rates.
