We've been discussing and reflecting on the Future of Identity over the last couple of months. It's apparent to us that Identity is rapidly growing in its complexity. The surface area that our customers need to protect is growing, like a sunrise revealing a hidden terrain in the morning twilight. We realize that in a short time, the **growing demands of customers will start to influence the roadmaps of SaaS companies and their developers to keep pace with protecting their customers and differentiating their value in their respective markets.** The timing of this discussion couldn't be better! We would love to meet you, hear about your vision and challenges, and nerd out on Identity and Software Development. Join us at Caesars Forum in Las Vegas, NV, on October 15-17, 2024, for [Oktane](https://www.okta.com/oktane), the biggest identity event of the year, and learn how to propel your SaaS apps into the future by connecting with Okta!

> If you are currently not attending Oktane (but would like to) and you build SaaS apps, please reach out to us at `dev-advocacy` at okta dot com to request information regarding how you can obtain a pass. Limited number of passes available so reach out soon!

We planned fantastic events to help you take your SaaS apps to the next level by leveraging Okta's identity and user lifecycle platforms. Find us and let's chat at these activities: 

## Breakout sessions

**Building a SaaS Application with CIC** <br/>
Wednesday Oct 16, 3:45 PM

**Empower your Ecosystem with Okta** <br/>
Thursday Oct 17, 12:45 PM

**B2B SaaS App of the Future** <br/>
Thursday Oct 17, 2:30 PM


## Stop by the Oktane Dev Hub

Take a drive through the Oktane Expo Hall, and you'll find the SaaS B2B experience in the Dev Hub at the intersection of SaaS Way and Integration Drive. Here, you'll discover the ways Okta can help you create secure B2B SaaS applications. You'll learn about identity and user lifecycle management best practices. Then build these standards-compliant solutions into your apps so you can submit them to the [Okta Integration Network](https://www.okta.com/okta-integration-network/) (OIN) and watch your customer base grow!

## Check out the Oktane Hands-on Labs for interactive learning opportunities

Roll up your sleeves and get your coding on. This is your chance to get techy and build code using Okta solutions. Find us at labs where you can pick from options such as:

**Scaling Okta App Management by Importing Data from PowerShell into Terraform** <br/>
Streamline and scale your Okta app management by using PowerShell to export configurations and use Terraform to automate environment transitions.

**Universal Logout: Instantly Sign a User Out across All Your Apps** <br/>
Learn how to lock down all your apps and protect your customers completely at the first sign of trouble with one API!

**Identify Inactive Okta Users with Okta Workflows** <br/>
Determine if you have unused accounts that might have been missed by some manual deprovisioning process.

Labs are first-come-first-serve and have limited capacity. If there's a lab you're interested in, be sure to show up on time!

## B2B SaaS builders happy hour

Join us at a special event for those who build apps that connect with Okta for their customer base! This happy hour is where all the fun and connections happen. This is a private event exclusively for techy folk who build multi-tenant B2B SaaS applications and want to offer Okta Identity Provider connections as an option for their customers. Does this describe you and are you interested in attending this event? Please contact us at `dev-advocacy` at okta dot com to be added to our guest list. You must be an attendee at Oktane to attend this happy hour. 

## Okta Workflows community meetup
