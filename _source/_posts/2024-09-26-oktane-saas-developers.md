The future of identity is at [Oktane](https://www.okta.com/oktane). Join us at Caesars Forum, Las Vegas, NV, on October 15-17, 2024, for the biggest identity event of the year, and learn how to propel your SaaS apps into the future by connecting with Okta!

We planned fantastic events to help you take your SaaS apps to the next level by leveraging Okta's identity and user lifecycle platforms. We'll be there, and we can't wait to meet you at these activities:

## Stop by the Oktane Dev Hub

Take a drive through Oktane, and you'll find the SaaS B2B experience in the Dev Hub at the intersection of SaaS Way and Integration Drive. Here, you'll discover the ways Okta can help you create secure B2B SaaS applications. You'll learn about identity and user lifecycle management best practices. Then build these standards-compliant solutions into your apps so you can submit them to the [Okta Integration Network](https://www.okta.com/okta-integration-network/) (OIN) and watch your customer base grow!

## Check out the DevLabs for interactive learning opportunities

Roll up your sleeves and get your coding on. This is your chance to get techy and build code using Okta solutions. Find us at labs where you can pick from options such as:
  1. Automating your environment using the Okta Terraform provider 
  2. Reacting to security threats and managing authenticated sessions programmatically with Universal Logout
  3. Cleaning up inactive users with Okta workflows

Labs are first-come-first-serve and have limited capacity. If there's a lab you're interested in, be sure to show up on time!

## B2B SaaS builders happy hour

Join us at a special event for those who build apps that connect with Okta for their customer base! This happy hour is where all the fun and connections happen. This is a private event exclusively for techy folk who build multi-tenant B2B SaaS applications and want to offer Okta Identity Provider connections as an option for their customers. Does this describe you and are you interested in attending this event? Connect with us by commenting below!

## Okta Workflows community meetup
