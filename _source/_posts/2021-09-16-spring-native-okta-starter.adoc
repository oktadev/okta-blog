In the fall of 2020, the Spring team released a new experimental project that gave Spring developers hope for faster startup times. It was called Spring Native. Spring Native is all about converting your Spring applications to native executables. It leverages GraalVM to make it happen. This was huge because the new kids on the block, Micronaut and Quarkus, produced native executables by default.

I was really excited about Spring Native when I first heard about it. Its first release (v0.8.3) was on Nov 23, 2020, but I started playing with it in September 2020, probably due to SpringOne. How do I know this? Because that's when I first tried it, and https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/issues/192[entered an issue for the Okta Spring Boot starter]. I was able to get things working with Spring Security's OAuth dependencies (instead of the Okta starter) in the waning weeks of 2020.

== Branching Out with Spring Native

According to VMWare Tanzu's recent https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/ebooks/the-state-of-spring-2021[State of Spring 2021 report], a lot of people know about Spring Native, but it's still early.

I wrote about link:/blog/2021/06/18/native-java-framework-comparison[how to build native Java apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot] earlier this summer and included my learnings. Around the same time, I thought to myself, "it'd sure be nice if the Okta Spring Boot starter worked with Spring Native."

To solve this desire, I scheduled a Twitch stream with link:/blog/authors/brian-demers[Brian Demers] and https://joshlong.com/[Josh Long]. We spent 90 minutes figuring things out. You can watch our struggles, collaborations, and ultimate joy in the https://youtu.be/8vY-9tXlCW4[video below]. I added a detailed table of contents to the video's description on YouTube, so you can skip around if you like.

This stream originally aired on June 22, 2021. Since then, there have been a few Spring Boot releases and several Spring Native releases. And don't forget, there was another https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1433495423319216131[SpringOne]!

== Okta Spring Boot Starter v2.2 Supports Spring Native!

Today, I'm happy to announce that we've added our learnings to https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/releases/tag/okta-spring-boot-parent-2.2.0[Okta Spring Boot v2.2.0]; now, it only takes a couple of lines to add native support to a Spring Boot application that uses Okta.

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint;
@NativeHint(options = "--enable-https")
----

Or, if you'd prefer a full example:

[source,java]
----
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint;

@NativeHint(options = "--enable-https")
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
----

If you'd like to see what it takes to migrate my previously mentioned native Java + Spring Boot example from using Spring Security OAuth to the Okta starter, look no further than https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples/pull/5[@oktadev/native-java-examples#5].

You can also try it out yourself with the https://cli.okta.com[Okta CLI]. Install it and follow along below for a quick Okta + Spring Native example.

== Create a Native Spring Boot App

To create a secure Spring Boot app with Okta, run `okta start spring-boot`. You'll need to verify your email and set a password as part of this.

TIP: If you already have an Okta account, you can run `okta login` first.

This command will download our https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-spring-boot-sample[Okta Spring Boot sample], register your app on Okta, and configure it by adding your Okta settings to `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

Add `@NativeHint(options = "--enable-https")` to the main `Application` class as specified above.

Next, edit your `pom.xml` and add the Spring Native version and classifier to the `<properties>` section:

[source,xml]
----
<spring-native.version>0.10.3</spring-native.version>
<repackage.classifier/>
----

Then, replace the `<build>` section with the XML below:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <defaultGoal>spring-boot:run</defaultGoal>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
