As mobile app usage is expected to continue to grow, now is as good a time as any to get into the market. Android is by far the most popular OS worldwide and the dominant way to get Android apps to phone users is the Google Play Store. In this tutorial, you'll build a React Native app and I'll walk you through everything from how to pick a design, as well as setting up your React Native environment, tips for getting the most out of your editor, and publishing it on Google Play.

This is what the eventual app will look like:

{% img blog/react-native-android-play-store/final.png alt:"Final Result" width:"283" %}{: .center-image }

For this tutorial, I checked out Karan Goel's [Mega Project List](https://github.com/karan/Projects#mega-project-list) for project inspiration. You'll be building the **Prime Factorization** problem which takes a number and returns its prime factors.

## Determine Interface Theming for Your React Native App
Outside of application logic, UI and theming decisions are some of the most important that you'll make for your app This includes the controls like dropdowns and buttons, as well as the layout on the screen. Since we are using a React-based technology, we're going to use [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) which is a popular, light-weight approach to theming React applications (and it also [works great on React Native](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#react-native)). There's an [entire page](https://github.com/styled-components/awesome-styled-components#built-with-styled-components) listing components and component-systems based on Styled Components. In this tutorial, you'll be using Styled Components to build up components yourself.

## Set Up Your Android Production Environment
In order to build the eventual APK (the format of the app you'll upload to the store), you need to [install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/). Once done make sure you have SDK version 27 as this is what React Native uses.

### Install the JDK
You also need to make sure you have a recent Java Development Kit installed (like version 8). The installation differs depending on your platform. You can use [Oracle's Java SDK](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html) or use [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) to install other options, like OpenJDK.

### Add the React Native CLI and Initialize the Skeleton
Next, you should install the React Native Command Line Interface. For this, you should make sure you have [Node installed](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+nodejs) which varies depending on your operating system. (I am using [version 8.12.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/)).

```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli@2.0.1
```

You should have a command `react-native` available to you, which includes the **init** option.

```bash
react-native init prime_components
```

This will create the `prime_components` directory and put a React Native project inside, with a runnable skeleton. Change to the directory, [connect your Android phone](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device) or [run an emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) (after having [installed Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)), and run the project.

**NOTE:** If Android Studio prompts you to open a project before you can create an emulator, you can point to the `prime_components/android` directory.

```bash
cd prime_components
react-native run-android
```

{% img blog/react-native-android-play-store/welcome.png alt:"Welcome to React Native" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }

To see the output you'll upload to the Play Store, go to `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug`. You should see an `app-debug.apk` that is around 8MB in size.

### Reduce the Output Size of Your Android App
You want to make sure your users have the smallest download possible. It's already quite small (around 8MB)  because you're using the command line (something like Expo produces 25MB for even basic apps) but we can [reduce it further]https://medium.com/@aswinmohanme/how-i-reduced-the-size-of-my-react-native-app-by-86-27be72bba640). Go to `android/app/build.gradle` and change the following variables to be `true`:

```
def enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture = true
def enableProguardInReleaseBuilds = true
```

You'll also have to remove the `ndk` section of `defaultConfig` to removing the [conflicting configuration in ndk abiFilters](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49802507) error:

```
ndk {
    abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "x86"
}
```

Now after re-running `react-native run-android` you should see two (much smaller - between 4MB and 5MB) APKs in the output directory.

### Add Linting to Your React Native App
Writing any JavaScript (like React) requires tools to ensure you haven't made any obvious mistakes which can be a big help for beginners. The most common of these is [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) which can be plugged right into your project and editor.

First, add the linter using NPM:

```bash
npm install -D eslint@5.9.0 babel-eslint@10.0.1
```

One common set of plugins is [Airbnb's configuration](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) so add those too:

```bash
npm install -D eslint-config-airbnb@17.1.0 eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@6.1.2 eslint-plugin-react@7.11.1 eslint-plugin-import@2.14.0
```

Now put the following into `.eslintrc.js` (you'll need to create this file):

```javascript
module.exports = {
  'extends': 'airbnb',
  'parser': 'babel-eslint',
  'env': {
    'jest': true,
  },
  'rules': {
    'no-use-before-define': 'off',
    'react/jsx-filename-extension': 'off',
    'react/prop-types': 'off',
    'comma-dangle': 'off'
  },
  'globals': {
    "fetch": false
  }
}
```

Now you just need to add the plugins to your editor. For Sublime there's [ESLint](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ESLint) which gives you an output of errors (or issues) with **CTRL + ALT + e** (**Cmd + Option + e** on Mac). There also [one for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

{% img blog/react-native-android-play-store/eslint.png alt:"ESLint" width:"500" %}{: .center-image }


A lot of these errors can be fixed automatically using the `eslint --fix` command which you can run from your editor with the [ESLint Fix](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ESLint%20Fix) package.

## Add Styled Components for React Native
React and React Native build interfaces using web technologies, i.e. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One very popular library to use with React (and React Native) is [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) which clean up how one adds CSS to your components.

For example, take a look at the following code, taken from the React Native sample app (which is what you get with `react-init`):

```javascript
export default class App extends Component<Props> {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.welcome}>Welcome to React Native!</Text>
      <Text style={styles.instructions}>To get started, edit App.js</Text>
      <Text style={styles.instructions}>{instructions}</Text>
    </View>
  );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',
  },
  welcome: {
    fontSize: 20,
    textAlign: 'center',
    margin: 10,
  },
  instructions: {
    textAlign: 'center',
    color: '#333333',
    marginBottom: 5,
  },
});
```

You declare your DOM elements (`View`, `Text`), linking them to styles, and then create the stylesheet later.

With Styled Components you would do the following:

```jsx
const Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #F5FCFF;
`;

const Welcome = styled.Text`
  fontSize: 20;
  text-align: center;
  margin: 10;
`;

const Instructions = styled.Text`
  text-align: center;
  color: #333333;
  margin-bottom: 5;
`;

export default class App extends Component<Props> {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Welcome>Welcome to React Native!</Welcome>
        <Instructions>To get started, edit App.js</Instructions>
      </Container>
  );
  }
}
```

It's both cleaner and more portable (CSS names don't clash, etc.).

To install it, run `npm install styled-components@4.1.1` from the root directory.

## Add Custom Fonts to Your React Native App
To get a custom font like [Racing Sans One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Racing+Sans+One?selection.family=Racing+Sans+One|Roboto) into your application you first need to download the ttf and put it into `assets/fonts` (you will need to create this directory). Then add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
"rnpm": {
  "assets": [
    "./assets/fonts/"
  ]
}
```

Finally run `react-native link` from the command line. You should now see your font inside of `android/app/src/main/assets/fonts`.  You should be able to use it now. Create a `components` folder and put the following inside of `components/Header.js`:

```javascript
import styled from 'styled-components/native';

export default styled.Text`
  color: black;
  font-family: RacingSansOne-Regular;
  font-size: 32px;
  margin-top: 120px;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-align: center;
`;
```

Then, import this into your `App.js` and add `<Heading>Welcome</Heading>` above the `Text` nodes:

```jsx
import Header from './components/Header';
...
export default class App extends Component<Props> {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Header>Welcome</Header>
        <Text style={styles.welcome}>Welcome to React Native!</Text>
        <Text style={styles.instructions}>To get started, edit App.js</Text>
        <Text style={styles.instructions}>{instructions}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

And you should get a nicely formatted header:

{% img blog/react-native-android-play-store/custom-fonts.png alt:"Custom fonts" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }

## Adjust Your App to be Fullscreen on Android
To get your app to not show the title bar, go to `android/app/src/main/res/values/styled.xml` and add the following inside the `<styles>` element:

```html
<item name="android:windowFullscreen">true</item>
```

Now when you re-run you should see the navigation bar is gone.

## Create the Android App Components
It can take a long time to decide on a final design, with layout, colors, and fonts. This is often an iterative process. Here you'll go through how to build up the final result you saw at the start - which was inspired by [related online tutorials](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/react-native-tutorial-part-2-designing-a-calculator) and [styling examples](https://moarwick.github.io/react-super-styled/) - but remember that it takes time to get to something you like.

Change `App.js` to the following:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Container, Header, Input, Keypad, ButtonRow } from './components';

const App = () => (
  <Container>
    <Header>Prime Components</Header>
    <Input>123456</Input>
    <Keypad>
      <ButtonRow keys={['1','2','3']} />
      <ButtonRow keys={['4','5','6']} />
      <ButtonRow keys={['7','8','9']} />
      <ButtonRow keys={['0','Clear','Go']} />
    </Keypad>
  </Container>
);

export default App;
```

You can see here how clean things are with Styled Components. We have a header, an input and a keypad (all names you choose) all surrounded by a container. No superfluous information. The styling happens in the components.

Create the `components` directory. Inside `components/index.js` put the following:

```javascript
export { default as Input } from './Input';
export { default as Container } from './Container';
export { default as Header } from './Header';
export { default as Keypad } from './Keypad';
export { default as Button } from './Button';
export { default as ButtonRow } from './ButtonRow';
```

This is just a convenience module that allows for the importing as in `App.js`, i.e. `
import { Container, Header, Input, Keypad, ButtonRow } from './components';`. Otherwise, you'd have to import each component on a separate line.

Put this into `components/Container.js`: (Note: you must use capital letters for your components in React Native!)

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components/native';

export default Container = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
`;
```

Very simple: you are extending a `View` component and assigning a flex value of one (which in this context means "take up everything").

`components/Header.js`:

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components/native';

export default Header = styled.Text`
  flex: 1.5;
  font-size: 80px;
  font-family: Chathura-ExtraBold;
  background-color: rgb(29, 31, 33);
  color: gold;
  text-align: center;
`;
```

Also, a styled text component, with large, centered fonts, a gold color, and grey background. Make sure you **install the [Chathura font](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Chathura)** from Google Fonts as before!

`components/Input.js`:

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components/native';

export default Input = styled.Text`
  flex: 2;
  text-align: right;
  font-family: Audiowide-Regular;
  text-align-vertical: center;
  font-size: 70;
  color: firebrick;
  background-color: gold;
`;
```

Similar to before except now with the Audiowide-Regular font (also [available from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Audiowide)).

`components/Keypad.js`:

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components/native';

export default Keypad = styled.View`
  flex: 6;
  background-color: rgb(29, 31, 33);
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 10px;
`;
```

Also just a styled view (essentially a container like a `<div>` in HTML).

`components/ButtonRow.js`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components/native';
import { Button } from '.';

const RowBox = styled.View`
  flex: 1;
  flex-direction: row;
`;

export default ButtonRow = ({keys}) => (
  <RowBox>
    { /* https://stackoverflow.com/a/32157488 */ }
    {keys.map(key => (
      <Button text={key} key={key} />
    ))}
  </RowBox>
);
```

Here, things get complicated. You are importing a `Button` from the current directory (which you'll create in a second), creating a component called `RowBox` which is not exported, and then `ButtonRow` is defined having a [React property](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) called `keys`.

Then you are mapping each key to a button component. This is a clean way of looping through an array as with `for each` and using the value to set both the `text` and `key` attributes (you must set a key attribute to make the DOM object unique!). You'll be using the text to render the button.

`components/Button.js`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components/native';

/* https://kylewbanks.com/blog/react-native-tutorial-part-2-designing-a-calculator */

/* https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/149 */
const ButtonBox = styled.TouchableHighlight.attrs({
  underlayColor: '#193441',
})`
  flex: 1;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background-color: rgb(39, 41, 43);
  border-radius: 10px;
  margin: 5px;
`;

const ButtonText = styled.Text`
  font-size: 30;
  font-family: Orbitron-Bold;
  color: ${props => props.text=="Go" ? "green" : "orange"};
`;

handleButtonPress = (value) => {
 
};

export default Button = ({text}) => (
  <ButtonBox onPress={() => handleButtonPress()}>
    <ButtonText text={text}>{text}</ButtonText>
  </ButtonBox>
);
```

This is the last component. You start by creating a `ButtonBox` which just acts as a container over the whole button. It is using [TouchableHighlight](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/touchablehighlight) which is a React Native component that will change color when touched. The styling is normal except for the underlay color (the color you see when touching) since this needs to be [hacked to work in Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/149).

Next, you have `ButtonText` which is a text control. **Install Orbitron-Bold** [from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Orbitron) for this. The color is set using a boolean check (another great feature of Styled Components, full-CSS support). Essentially the color will be green if the text is "Go", and orange otherwise. 

Next, define a function to handle button presses (empty for now), and then export the `Button` component that combines the two. Set the `text` attribute on `ButtonText` using the property set on `Button` so that Styled Components can see it when you set the styles.

Once done, you should see the app render as you saw at the top of this article.

## Add Colors to Your Android App
The colors in the Android Emulator may not always match once you're viewing it on an actual phone. This is because [Android Oreo fixed color management](https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-android-color-management) to ensure things looked the same across devices. If you're having similar issues, see if you are using Android 7 or before.

You could restrict your users to Android 8 or above, but right now that's only [about 20% of Android users](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/) so probably best just to put a message somewhere that things look a bit better on later versions.

## Wire Up Your Buttons in React
That is it for the basic design and layout. Now you need to connect the buttons so they actually do something. To start, you need to make pressing the numbers (and clear key) add and remove numbers from the number display.

For this, you need to understand state in React.

### Lifting Up State
We need a single source of truth for the current number (to be displayed) and the callback function that will modify it. It has to be a parent of both (the `Input` and the `Button`). Since this is part of the app you can put this into the `App` component in `App.js`.

Start by modifying `App.js` and converting it to a React class (from the current functional definition) since [you need this to capture state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Container, Header, Input, Keypad, ButtonRow } from './components';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Header>Prime Components</Header>
        <Input>123456</Input>
        <Keypad>
          <ButtonRow keys={['1','2','3']} />
          <ButtonRow keys={['4','5','6']} />
          <ButtonRow keys={['7','8','9']} />
          <ButtonRow keys={['0','Clear','Go']} />
        </Keypad>
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

`App` is now a [JavaScript ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), and it has a `render()` method which returns the JSX.

Reload the emulator/app (in the emulator you can use R+R) and it should still render as before.

Now add the following above your `render()` method:

```javascript
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {number:123456};
}
```

You are overriding the [React constructor](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#constructor), calling the parent (which you always must) and then setting the state to a JSON object with one member: `number` (which we've initialized to our old value: 123456).

Now add this above the `return(...)` in `App.js`:

```javascript
const { state } = this;
```

This [destructures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) the state from `this` into a local variable. Change the `<Input>` line to `<Input>{state.number}</Input>`. Now the input is being rendered from the state. Reload and you should see the same output (and change the state constructor to see it changing).
### Modifying State in React
Now, you need to tell each button to call a function defined in your App class. Add the following to the constructor:

```javascript
this.press = this.press.bind(this);
```

This will make the `press` function have access to `this` (which is needed when you called `this.setState`).

Next, define a press function which just alerts which button was pressed.

```javascript
press = (value) => {
  alert(value);
};
```

Now pass this function to your button rows:

```jsx
<ButtonRow func={this.press} keys={['1','2','3']} />
<ButtonRow func={this.press} keys={['4','5','6']} />
<ButtonRow func={this.press} keys={['7','8','9']} />
<ButtonRow func={this.press} keys={['0','Clear','Go']} />
```

Modify `ButtonRow` to take in this value and pass it to the created `Button`s.

```jsx
export default ButtonRow = ({func,keys}) => (
  <RowBox>
    {keys.map(key => (
      <Button func={func} text={key} key={key} />
    ))}
  </RowBox>
);
```

Finally, change `Button` to take in this function and call it with the pressed button. You can also remove the previous button handler.

```jsx
export default Button = ({func,text}) => (
  <ButtonBox onPress={() => func(text)}>
	<ButtonText text={text}>{text}</ButtonText>
  </ButtonBox>
);
```

Now when you press a button you should see an alert with what you pressed:

{% img blog/react-native-android-play-store/buttons.png alt:"Buttons" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }

You now have a single function, defined at the __top__, which controls what buttons do.

### Use Class Properties Correctly in React
To clean things up a bit you can use class properties to initialize state in React. Simply take out the constructor and replace it with this:

```javascript
state = {
  number: 123456
};
```

### Update Your React Native App Display
As number buttons are pressed, you need to add said number to the current number. Also, when **Clear** is pressed you have to delete. Do that first. Change `press()` to the following:

```javascript
press = (value) => {
  let { number } = this.state;
  if (value === 'Clear') {
    number = Math.floor(number / 10);
    this.setState({ number });
  }
}
```

First, this pulls out the value of the number from the state using destructuring (using your linter previously you'll see it is preferred). Then if the key is `Clear`, divide the number by ten, floor it (i.e. remove the last digit), and then set the state. That should be enough to make the clear button work.

Now add the following to the if statement in `press()`:

```javascript
else if (value != 'Go' && number<1000000) {
  number += value;
  this.setState({ number });
}
```

So if `Go` hasn't been pressed and the value is less than one million (you have to stop somewhere - phones aren't that fast), add the value to the back (interpreting it as a string instead of integer) and again, set the state. That should make every button work.

The only thing left to do is the `Go` button.

###  Add Screens to Your Android App
When the `Go` button is pressed you want to hide the keypad and show a progress screen. For this you need another state variable, a boolean, so add it to the state class property, i.e.

```javascript
state = {
  number: 123456,
  processing: false
};
```

Also add a check for `Go` in the **press** function:

``` javascript
else if (value === 'Go') {
  this.setState({ processing: true });
}
```

Then create `components/Processing.js`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components/native';

const ProcessingBox = styled.Text`
  flex: 6;
  font-size: 30;
  text-align: center;
  text-align-vertical: center;
  font-family: Orbitron-Bold;
  color: red;
  background-color: rgb(29, 31, 33);
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 10px;
`;

export default () => (
  <ProcessingBox>Processing</ProcessingBox>
);
```

Add it to your `components/index.js`:

```js
export { default as Processing } from './Processing';
```

Then import it at the top of your `App.js`:

```js
import { Container, Header, Input, Keypad, ButtonRow, Processing } from './components';
```

And use the `processing` boolean to decide whether to render it or the keypad:

```jsx
{state.processing ? (
  <Processing />
) : (
  <Keypad>
    <ButtonRow func={this.press} keys={['1', '2', '3']} />
    <ButtonRow func={this.press} keys={['4', '5', '6']} />
    <ButtonRow func={this.press} keys={['7', '8', '9']} />
    <ButtonRow func={this.press} keys={['0', 'Clear', 'Go']} />
  </Keypad>
)}
```

This checks if `state.processing` is true and if so, show the processing. Otherwise, show the keypad.

## Calculate Prime Factors 
The simplest way to break a number down into prime factors is looping through all numbers from 2 to `num/2` (since anything greater than `num/2` won't be a factor) and check if it divides. However, what about number 4? It is not prime. So we should also check if each factor is prime.

A clever algorithm is described [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-prime-factors-of-a-given-number/). Start with 2 - keep dividing `num` by 2 and for each case add 2 to the list until it won't divide anymore.

```javascript
while (num%2 == 0) {
  addFactor(2);
  num = num/2;
}
```

Now `num` will be odd. Start the same process from 3 except only go until the square root of `num`, incrementing by 2 (only odd numbers):

```javascript
for (int i = 3; i <= Math.floor(Math.sqrt(num)); i += 2) {
  while (num%i == 0) {
    add_factor(i);
    num = num/i;
  }
}
```

Note you have to use floor in JavaScript when dealing with things like square root because all numbers in JavaScript are floats (actually doubles).

So similarly, keep adding the divisor as a factor until there is no more remainder left.

The last step is to check if the number you have left is great than 1. If so, it must be prime!

```javascript
if (num > 1) { add_factor(num); } 
```

You'll be putting this all together shortly.

Now that you have the code you need to display the results.

### Display Lists in React Native
To display lists you need to use a React Native list view, in our cast, a `FlatList`. This takes a list of values (objects) called `data` and a way to render each item called `renderItem`.

```jsx
<FlatList
  data={[{key: 'a'}, {key: 'b'}]}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.key}</Text>}
/>
```

Change `components/Processing.js` to the following:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { FlatList } from 'react-native';
import styled from 'styled-components/native';

const ProcessingBox = styled.View`
  flex: 6;
  background-color: rgb(29, 31, 33);
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 10px;
`;

const Header = styled.Text`
  font-size: 30;
  text-align: center;
  text-align-vertical: center;
  font-family: Orbitron-Bold;
  color: red;
  padding-top: 10px;
`;

const Item = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20;
  text-align: center;
  text-align-vertical: center;
  font-family: Audiowide-Regular;
  color: firebrick;
`;

export default () => (
  <ProcessingBox>
    <Header>Processing</Header>
    <FlatList
      data={[{ key: '2' }, { key: '2' }, { key: '3' }, { key: '5' }]}
      renderItem={({ item }) => <Item>{item.key}</Item>}
    />
  </ProcessingBox>
);
```

So you have a `ProcessingBox`, a `Header` and an `Item` which are combined in the export. You should see the following when you click **Go**:

{% img blog/react-native-android-play-store/processing.png alt:"Processing" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }

## Pulling Your React Native App Together
To make this work with the app you need to control the rendering from outside, so change the render method to the following:

```jsx
export default ({ running, factors, press }) => (
  <ProcessingBox>
    {running ? (
      <Header>Processing</Header>
    ) : (
      <Header>Finished</Header>
    )}
    <List
      data={factors}
      renderItem={({ item }) => <Item>{item.key}</Item>}
    />
    {!running && (
      <Button func={() => press('Back')} text="Back" />
    )}
  </ProcessingBox>
);
```

Here the control takes in three variables, which control which header is shown, the prime factors being displayed, and the function used to switch the parent state (the same function used when buttons are pressed), respectively.

`FlatList` has been replaced with `List` which is just a styled component to control the size of the list rendering. Add the following to `Processing.js`:

```jsx
const List = styled.FlatList`
  flex: 5;
`;
```

There is also a `Button` which is your own control. Import it with `import { Button } from '.';`.

Now move on to `App.js` and change the `<Processing />` tag in `render()` to:

```jsx
<Processing running={state.running} factors={state.factors} press={this.press} />
```

So you're passing the three parameters just discussed, the first two from the state. Now change the state property to include these new values:

```javascript
state = {
  number: 123456,
  factors: [],
  processing: false,
  running: false
};
```

Now below this, in the `App` class, put the function for calculating primes:

```javascript
getPrimes = (N) => {
  const factors = [];
  let num = N;
  while (num % 2 === 0) {
    factors.push({ key: '2' });
    num /= 2;
  }
  let i; for (i = 3; i <= Math.floor(Math.sqrt(num)); i += 2) {
    while (num % i === 0) {
      factors.push({ key: `${i}` });
      num /= i;
    }
  }
  if (num > 1) { factors.push({ key: `${num}` }); }
  return factors;
};
```

Finally, change the `press` function to get these factors and set the state using them (as well as respond correctly to the **Back** button in the processing screen:

```javascript
press = (value) => {
  let { number } = this.state;
  if (value === 'Clear') {
    number = Math.floor(number / 10);
    this.setState({ number });
  } else if (value !== 'Go' && value !== 'Back' && number < 1000000) {
    if (number === 0) number = value; else number += value;
    this.setState({ number });
  } else if (value === 'Go') {
    this.setState({ processing: true });
    let factors = this.getPrimes(number);
    this.setState({ running: false });
    this.setState({ factors });
  } else if (value === 'Back') {
    this.setState({ processing: false });
  }
};
```

Now when you run the app and press **Go** you should see a list of the prime factors, as well as a **Back** button which will take you back.

{% img blog/react-native-android-play-store/finished.png alt:"Finished" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }


Editing the number and re-clicking **Go** should get a new list of factors. Congrats, you've finished the app!

## Set Your Android App Name and Icon
To make things look good once deployed on the phone you need to set the name and icon. You can set the name in `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`:

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">Prime Components</string>
</resources>
```

For the icon, it's best to open your project in Android Studio (use the `android` directory) and create a 'drawable' directory in `assets`. Then right-click and say **New -> Image Asset**. This will let you import your large icon and overwrite `ic_launcher` which is what is used for the launcher icon, generating all the versions you need for the Play Store. Re-deploy with `react-native run-android` and you should see a proper name and icon on your apps list.

If you get a bundling issue next time you run `react-native run-android` when running on Android there is a [Stack Overflow fix](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44476757) that works.

## Add Authentication with AppAuth
Authentication may not be mission-critical to a calculator, but it's often wise to add while your app's features remain simple. As you add features you may want to give users the option to save a calculation history or share their work with friends. These features will require the kind of secure user management Okta makes simple.

First add a new `Login.js` component by copying `Button.js` and changing the font size to 20, the border radius and margin to zero, and the background color to something lighter like `rgb(49, 51, 53)`. 

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components/native';

const ButtonBox = styled.TouchableHighlight.attrs({
  underlayColor: '#193441',
})`
  flex: 1;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background-color: rgb(49, 51, 53);
  border-radius: 0;
  margin: 0;
`;

const ButtonText = styled.Text`
  font-size: 20;
  font-family: Orbitron-Bold;
  color: orange;
`;

export default Login = ({func,text}) => (
  <ButtonBox onPress={() => func(text)}>
    <ButtonText text={text}>{text}</ButtonText>
  </ButtonBox>
);
```

Add it to `index.js` in the components directory, import it at the top of `App.js` and add `loggedin: false` to the `App` class state. Finally, below the `<Input>` control in render put a switch to determine what to print on the login button:

```jsx
    {state.loggedin ? (
      <Login text="Logout" />
    ) : (
      <Login text="Login" />
    )}
```

When you re-run the project you should see a new login button.



Note: if you are not seeing any changes from your code reflected in the `react-native run-android` deploy it might be because you removed internet permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` which React Native uses to connect the app with your development machine. Simply replace it above the `application` directive:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

{% include setup/cli.md type="native"
   loginRedirectUri="com.okta.dev-133337:/callback"
   logoutRedirectUri="com.okta.dev-133337:/callback" %}

Now install [react-native-app-auth](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-native-app-auth) and link it.

```bash
react-native install react-native-app-auth@4.0.0
react-native link react-native-app-auth
```

Now add the following to the `defaultConfig` section of the `android` config in `android/app/build.gradle`, using the base of your **Redirect URL**, e.g. `com.okta.dev-133337`.

```gradle
defaultConfig {
    applicationId "com.prime_components"
    ...
    manifestPlaceholders = [
        appAuthRedirectScheme: "{redirectBase}"
    ]
}
```

At the top of your `App.js` import **Alert** from the React Native package and **authorize** and **revoke** from the App Auth package:

```javascript
import { Alert } from 'react-native';
import { authorize, revoke } from 'react-native-app-auth';
```

Before you define your `App` class, add a `config` variable with the details of your Okta app:

```javascript
const config = {
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{clientId}',
  redirectUrl: '{redirectUrl}',
  additionalParameters: {},
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access']
};
```

Now add `accessToken: ''` to your state initialization and add the following two functions to your `App` class:

```javascript
  state = {
    ...
    accessToken: '',
  };

...

authorize = async () => {
  try {
    const authState = await authorize(config);

    this.setState({
      loggedin: true,
      accessToken: authState.accessToken
    });
  } catch (error) {
    Alert.alert('Failed to log in', error.message);
  }
};

revoke = async () => {
  try {
    const { state } = this;
    await revoke(config, {
      tokenToRevoke: state.accessToken,
      sendClientId: true
    });
    this.setState({
      accessToken: '',
      loggedin: false
    });
  } catch (error) {
    Alert.alert('Failed to revoke token', error.message);
  }
};
```

Finally add `func={this.authorize}` as an attribute on your login button and `func={this.revoke}` to your logout button.

```jsx
{state.loggedin ? (
  <Login text="Logout" func={this.revoke}/>
) : (
  <Login text="Login" func={this.authorize}/>
)}
```

Now when you re-run and click `Login` you should be redirected to an Okta login screen. Using the login details of a user attached to your Okta application should redirect you back to your app, now showing a logout button. When you click on logout, and then log in again, you'll notice you're not prompted to log in again. To fix this, you can add a login prompt to `additionalParameters`.

```js
const config = {
  ...
  additionalParameters: {prompt: 'login'},
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access']
};
```

This ensures the user is prompted for their password every time.

## Launch Your Android App on the Play Store
The last step is publishing what you have done on the Play Store. The standard docs have [great advice on this](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/) as well as a [pre-launch checklist](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/launch-checklist). Besides reading the developer policies (which you should do) you need to [sign up for a developer account](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435) and pay the $25 registration fee. Then you need to create an icon.

### Create an Icon for Your Android App
It not easy making something unique and striking as well as relevant to your app. For this tutorial, check out [Iconic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xeus.iconic) (a mobile app on the Play Store) which links into free icon repositories and lets you edit them. With it you can create graphics like the following:

{% img blog/react-native-android-play-store/icon.png alt:"App icon" width:"100" %}{: .center-image }

### Create an Android Application in the Play Store Console
Open up the Play Console and click **Create Application**. Select the default language, enter a name and click **Create**. You will now see a lot you need to fill out in the store listing, including a least:

* A short description
* A long description
* Two screenshots
* A [feature graphic](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/feature-graphic)
* A high-res icon (512x512)
* Categorization (app type and category)
* Email address

You also need to specify if you are providing a privacy policy.

For the feature graphic, you need something that is exactly 1024x500. You can get royalty free images from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com) (for example [this one](https://pixabay.com/en/banner-number-digit-maths-1183443/)) though you will have to resize them with something like [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) (and make sure on Pixabay that the image is free for commercial use!).

Once done click **Save Draft** and you should see a large green tick on the side panel next to _Store listing_.

{% img blog/react-native-android-play-store/store-listing.png alt:"Store listing" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }

This shows you have completed the listing details and still need to fill out the content rating form as well as pricing and distribution. Although before you can do that you need to put out an app release.

### App Releases
Click on **App release** in the sidebar. You should see a list of __tracks__ for various testing phases. Click on `MANAGE` in the production track. Then click `CREATE RELEASE`.

You'll see a message about using **App signing by Google Play**. This is a new feature which puts the managing of keys into Google's hands. The reason you'd want this is simple: if you manage your own keys and you lose them you will no longer be able to release updates for your app. In fact, you'd have to create a new one under a new name! However, note that this is an option. Here you'll be using it. For that, you will need to [generate an upload key](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key).

* Open your app in Android Studio by browsing to the `android` folder of your React Native project
* Go to **Build > Generate signed bundle / APK**
* Select **APK** and click **Next**
* Under __Key store path__ click **Create new**
* Choose a path like `/home/karl/keystores/android.jks`
* Choose passwords for the keystore and key
* Enter the certificate information (note: this won't be displayed in the app, just the certificate)

{% img blog/react-native-android-play-store/keystore.png alt:"Keystore" width:"500" %}{: .center-image }

Click `OK` and click **Next**. Select both the V1 and the [V2 signature version](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0#apk_signature_v2) and click **Finish**. A build should start after which you should see both `app-x86-release.apk` and `app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk` inside of `android/app/release` in your project (one for each device architecture).

If you try upload these apps now you will get an error saying "Your app is using permissions that require a privacy policy". This is because React Native [adds app permissions behind the scenes](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/removing-default-permissions). To force them to not be included you must first add `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"` to the `manifest` element of `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and then add the following (see the previous link for more):

```xml
<uses-permission tools:node="remove" android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
<uses-permission tools:node="remove" android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission tools:node="remove" android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

You can also remove the alert window and internet `uses-permission` since we're not using them. Re-build and re-upload. Put in some release notes and click `SAVE`.


### Content Rating
Now with the release made you can enter in rating information. Go to **Content rating** in the sidebar, read the message about IARC and click `CONTINUE`.

For type, click `Utility` at the bottom. Then a questionnaire will show. You can click **No** for all the fields. Click `SAVE QUESTIONNAIRE`. After this, you can click `CALCULATE RATING`. You will see a list of how your app will be rated. Scroll to the bottom and click `APPLY RATING`.

That should put a tick next to __Content rating__. The only thing left is pricing and distribution.

### Pricing & Distribution
This section should also be straight-forward since you are not charging for your app. Simply select the **Available** button at the top of the country columns to select all 143 countries as available. Then select no for child-directed and contains ads. Then check the Content Guidelines and US export laws checkboxes and click `SAVE DRAFT`.

At the top of the Play console, it should say **Ready to publish**.

### Releasing Your Android App
Go to **App release** and click `EDIT RELEASE`. Scroll to the bottom and click `REVIEW`. Click on `START ROLL-OUT TO PRODUCTION`. Click **Confirm**. Your app should now say **Pending publication** at the top. You now need to wait a few hours for Google to check your app before releasing it.

**NOTE:** It might be worthwhile using a testing release first to make sure everything works before you release to production, i.e. to everyone!
