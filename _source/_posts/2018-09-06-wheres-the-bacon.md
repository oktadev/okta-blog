I am so excited to announce I have joined Okta's developer relations team as a Senior Developer Advocate! My focus is on all the JavaScripts: Node.js, Vue, React, and a bazillion other things!

## My Origin Story

My first taste of programming was BASIC on the TRS-80. In the 90's, I wrote a lot of DOS and Windows applications using Pascal and Visual Basic. Around 1998, I made the jump to building Web applications using "classic" ASP, and have remained focused on the Web ever since.

In 2011, I worked up the courage to give my first technical talk at a meetup. I was terrible! Fortunately, there are amazing folks in the community. They invest their time in others and encourage people to share their experiences.

## Why Okta?
Have you ever secured an application? It's not a trivial task! Even more, it's a critical component of every application you can't afford to get wrong!

Okta is a trusted leader in single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, and user management. Okta's [developer products](https://developer.okta.com/product/) provide a painless solution for implementing a great security experience for customers. Their products also provide the peace of mind your applications remain secure as new threats emerge.

However, my decision to join Okta is not only about believing in their products. My new team is a fantastic group of folks who are genuinely passionate about the developer community. I am so excited to be serving the developer community with them!

## How can I help you be more awesome?

Over the last five years, I have resolved to make it my mission to give back to the developer community. I want to encourage folks to see the world through a bigger lens. All of us have incredible potential to impact our workplace, family, community, and the entire world, using the technology within our grasp.
