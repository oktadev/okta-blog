Over the years, I've developed a lot of Java applications. I spent 10 years doing Java before I tried another server-side application language. I was impressed when I first tried building apps in Ruby on Rails, Python, and Node.js - they all started super-fast!

Starting fast is cool, but we in the Java community have often asked, does it perform over time? The Java Virtual Machine is famous for performance and optimization over time.

I scoffed at serverless when it first came out. Mostly because I was a Java developer and my apps didn't start in milliseconds. They also used a whole lotta memory and there was no hope in sight.

Then, along came https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM]. It's gained support from many Java frameworks in the last few years and has made their apps start in milliseconds!

*Prerequisites*:

- https://sdkman.io/[Java 17 with GraalVM]+
- https://docs.docker.com/desktop/#download-and-install[Docker Desktop]

== Way should I care about Serverless and GraalVM?

From https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless[IBM's What is Serverless computing?]

> Serverless is a cloud execution model that enables a simpler, more cost-effective way to build and operate cloud-native applications.

That's it. For companies with high traffic and large cloud bills, serverless makes sense. They can save millions of dollars a month!

== Introducing JHipster 7: Fast Java for Everyone

I've been playing with GraalVM and the Java frameworks that support it for around 18 months. After doing a lot of research, I blogged about link:/blog/2021/06/18/native-java-framework-comparison[building native Java apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot].

In September 2021, I did a talk with Josh Long about Spring Native with JHipster at the San Francisco JUG. I flew out on a Monday, we got everything working by Wednesday afternoon, and then spoke about our experience on Wednesday night. I wrote about it in https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-matt-raible/[JHipster Works with Spring Native!] on LinkedIn and created a https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/16498[JHipster issue] to automate our learnings.

As a result of that presentation, we were invited to speak at the Garden State JUG in September. We laid low for a few months and rekindled our research in December. I wrote about it in https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-part-2-matt-raible/[JHipster works with Spring Native, Part 2!]

== ðŸ’¥ Introducing the JHipster Native blueprint!

In late January 2022, we upgraded JHipster to Spring Boot 2.6 and released version https://www.jhipster.tech/2022/01/23/jhipster-release-7.6.0.html[7.6.0].

In early February, I updated the Spring Native with JHipster examples that Josh and I'd been using for research. I was ready to start automating the Spring Native integration using a JHipster module. When https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/16498#issuecomment-1030263905[I asked the team] about the best way to do it, https://github.com/mshima[Marcelo Shima] volunteered to create the initial blueprint.

This was on a Friday afternoon (mountain time).

By the next morning, Marcelo had the MVP finished and provided steps to reproduce our examples!

I was amazed! I remember telling (my partner) Trish that he'd done a week worth of (my estimated) work in a matter of hours.

Today, I'm proud to announce the https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-native[JHipster Native blueprint] is available! Here's how to use it:

[source,shell]
----
npm install -g generator-jhipster-native
jhipster-native
----

This will generate a JHipster app and integrate GraalVM automatically. You can build and run a native image with the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw package -Pnative,prod -DskipTests
./target/native-executable
----

Gradle is not currently an option, but can be if we add support to the JHipster Native blueprint.

== Go native with Spring Native and GraalVM

Let's look at a https://auth0.com/blog/full-stack-java-with-react-spring-boot-and-jhipster/[previous JHipster app I created for the Auth0 blog]. First, clone the example:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git jhipster-native
cd jhipster-native
----

[TIP]
====
You can also clone the `spring-native` branch with the changes below already made:
----
git clone -b spring-native oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git jhipster-native
----

Then, skip to the <<Configure your OpenID Connect identity provider>> section to continue.
====

Install JHipster 7.6.0 and the JHipster Native blueprint:

[source,shell]
----
npm i -g generator-jhipster@7.6.0
npm i -g generator-jhipster-native@1.0.0
----

Then, remove all the existing project files and regenerate it. When prompted to `Overwrite .gitignore?`, type `a` to overwrite all files.

[source,shell]
----
rm -rf *
jhipster-native --with-entities
----

If you open the project in IntelliJ IDEA, you can use the *Commit Tools Window* (kbd:[{commandkey} + 0] on macOS or kbd:[Ctrl + 0] on Linux/Windows) to view files that changed.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-native-jhipster/commit-tools-window.png' %}[alt=IntelliJ IDEA's Commit Tools Window,width=800,align=center]

Next, run the following `git` commands to restore the files that were modified in the original example.

[source,shell]
----
git checkout .gitignore
git checkout README.md
git checkout demo.adoc
git checkout flickr.jdl
git checkout screenshots
git checkout src/test/javascript/cypress/integration/entity/photo.spec.ts
git checkout src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo.tsx
git checkout src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo-update.tsx
git checkout src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/config/SecurityConfiguration.java
git checkout src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/web/rest/PhotoResource.java
git checkout src/main/resources/config/application-heroku.yml
git checkout src/main/resources/config/bootstrap-heroku.yml
git checkout Procfile
git checkout system.properties
----

If you'd rather not use the command line, you can right-click on each file and select *Rollback*.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-native-jhipster/rollback-commit.png' %}[alt=Rollback...,width=800,align=center]

There are a few other changes I made in the first tutorial that will need to be re-applied:

. In `src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml`, remove the `faker` profile for Liquibase

. In `pom.xml`, re-add Drew Noake's `metadata-extractor` library:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.drewnoakes</groupId>
    <artifactId>metadata-extractor</artifactId>
    <version>2.16.0</version>
</dependency>
----

. Install the React libraries needed:
+
[source,shell]
----
npm i react-photo-gallery@8 --force
npm i react-images
----

. Add type hints for Drew Noake's library in your main application class:
+
[source,java]
----
@org.springframework.nativex.hint.TypeHint(
types = {
    ...
    com.drew.metadata.exif.ExifIFD0Directory.class,
    com.drew.metadata.exif.ExifSubIFDDirectory.class,
    com.drew.metadata.exif.makernotes.AppleMakernoteDirectory.class,
    com.drew.metadata.exif.GpsDirectory.class,
})
@org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint(options = "-H:+AddAllCharsets")
----
+
The `@NativeHint` solves this exception that happens when you save an image:
+
----
Caused by: java.nio.charset.UnsupportedCharsetException: Cp1252
at java.nio.charset.Charset.forName(Charset.java:528) ~[native-executable:na]
at com.drew.lang.Charsets.<clinit>(Charsets.java:40) ~[native-executable:2.16.0]
----

Once you've made all the changes (or cloned the `spring-native` branch), you can build the native binary.

== Build a native JHipster app

You will need a JDK with GraalVM and its `native-image` compiler. Using SDKMAN, run the following command and set it as the default:

[source,shell]
----
sdk install java 21.3.0.r17-grl
----

Add the native extension to the JDK:

[source,shell]
----
gu install native-image
----

Then, use Maven to build the project. Skip tests since there's no support for Mockito at this time.

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw package -Pnative,prod -DskipTests
----

This process will take several minutes to complete.

== Configure your OpenID Connect identity provider

When you generate a JHipster app with OAuth 2.0 / OIDC for authentication, it defaults to using Keycloak. It creates a `src/main/docker/keycloak.yml` file for Docker Compose, as well as a `src/main/docker/realm-config` directory with files to auto-create users and OIDC clients.

If you want to use Keycloak for your running app, start it with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
----

If you'd rather use Okta or Auth0, that's possible too!

=== Use Okta as your identity provider

The https://cli.okta.com[Okta CLI] makes it very simple to configure a JHipster application.

If you haven't used the Okta CLI before, and you already have an Okta developer account, run `okta login`. If you don't have an Okta developer account, you can create one with `okta register`.

[source,shell]
----
okta apps create jhipster
----

That's it!

You'll need to source the `.okta.env` file this command creates to override the default Spring Security settings.

[source,shell]
----
source .okta.env
----

NOTE: If you're on Windows, you can modify this file to use `set` instead of `export` and rename it to `okta.bat`. Then, run it with `okta.bat` from the command line.

CAUTION: Modify your existing `.gitignore` file to have `*.env` so you don't accidentally check in your secrets!

// todo: use cli include

=== Use Auth0 as your identity provider

To switch from Keycloak to Auth0, you only need to override the default properties (for Spring Security OAuth). You don't even need to write any code!

To see how it works, create a `.auth0.env` file in the root of your project, and fill it with the code below to override the default OIDC settings:

[source,shell]
----
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI=https://<your-auth0-domain>/
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
export JHIPSTER_SECURITY_OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=https://<your-auth0-domain>/api/v2/
----

You'll need to create a new web application in Auth0 and fill in the `<...>` placeholders before this works.

==== Create an OpenID Connect App on Auth0

Log in to your Auth0 account (or [sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) if you don't have an account). You should have a unique domain like `dev-xxx.eu.auth0.com`.

Press the **Create Application** button in [Applications section](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). Use a name like `JHipster Native!`, select `Regular Web Applications`, and click **Create**.

Switch to the **Settings** tab and configure your application settings:

- Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc`
- Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:8080/`

Scroll to the bottom and click **Save Changes**.

Copy your Auth0 domain, client ID, and client secret into the `.auth0.env` file you created earlier. Then, run `source .auth0.env`.

In the https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles[roles] section, create new roles named `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER`.

Create a new user account in the https://manage.auth0.com/#/users[users] section. Click on the **Role** tab to assign the roles you just created to the new account.

_Make sure your new user's email is verified before attempting to log in!_

Next, head to **Auth Pipeline** > **Rules** > **Create**. Select the `Empty rule` template. Provide a meaningful name like `Group claims` and replace the Script content with the following.

[source,js]
----
function(user, context, callback) {
  user.preferred_username = user.email;
  const roles = (context.authorization || {}).roles;

  function prepareCustomClaimKey(claim) {
    return `https://www.jhipster.tech/${claim}`;
  }

  const rolesClaim = prepareCustomClaimKey('roles');

  if (context.idToken) {
    context.idToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  if (context.accessToken) {
    context.accessToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}
----

This code is adding the user's roles to a custom claim (prefixed with `https://www.jhipster.tech/roles`). Click **Save changes** to continue.

**NOTE**: Want to have all these steps automated for you? Vote for [this issue](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli/issues/351) in the Auth0 CLI project.

== Run your native JHipster app

After you've built your app, it will be available in `target/native-executable`. Start Keycloak or source your Okta/Auth0 settings. Then, run `./target/native-executable`. It should start in under around one second!

== What does the JHipster Native blueprint do?

// collects findings from @starbuxman and @mraible's research:
// - 2021-12-14: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-part-2-matt-raible/
// - 2021-09-30: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-matt-raible/

// sometimes it's the small things: e.g., HashSet

https://github.com/mraible/spring-native-examples#readme

*TL;DR* It configures Spring Boot and GraalVM so it recognizes classes that are not easily discoverable. For example, those that are instantiated using reflection. It's a really slick extension to Spring Boot and will likely disappear with Spring Boot 3 because it'll be native by default.

What does it do? We've basically automated the README above!

----
/me I could copy and paste it here, but it's easier to just update it in one place. ;)
----

The only major thing I found is it https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/issues/465[doesn't support caching]. If you're looking to start/stop your infra as fast as possible, you probably don't care about caching. Caching is made for long-lived, JVM-strong, JVM-loving apps.

== What about Spring Boot 3?

// an attempt, but no demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2_-eC7Mpfk
// if demo ready, schedule!

== Automate the wait

jhipster ci-cd

Options:

- Modify the generated YAML to use the GraalVM plugin
- Revert the script changes in package.json so it's just a JVM build. Add a publish script that only builds when you create a release.
- Nightly build of native https://kyuubang.github.io/devops/2022/01/22/nightly-build-with-github-actions.html

This post is already long enough. I'll show you in a future post!
