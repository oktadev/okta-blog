So, you're building a custom app and you need to include support for multi-factor authentication (MFA). Did you know that [Okta's API](https://developer.okta.com/) can support multi-step MFA workflows?

The diagram below shows the primary authentication flows with MFA enrollment and enforcement enabled.

Okta has a push-based verification app called Okta Verify. It's available on the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.okta.android.auth&hl=en) and [Apple App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/okta-verify/id490179405?mt=8) stores. Okta Verify is similar to Google Authenticator, except it adds the additional feature of supporting push notifications. We think this strikes a really great balance between additional security and user experience.

I created a screencast to demonstrate how you can manage the whole MFA enrollment and enforcement process using the Okta API [here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/EVL3gnt7BYo) or you can watch below:
