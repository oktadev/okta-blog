Jetty is a small, highly-scalable Java-based web server and servlet engine. It supports HTTP/2, WebSockets, and many other protocols. It powers websites and frameworks, both large and small, such as Google AppEngine. Because it is an Eclipse project, its open source project is called Eclipse Jetty. It is standards-compliant and open source, as well as commercially usable. It is the main alternative to Tomcat when hosting Java applications. Like Tomcat, you can use Jetty both embedded and stand-alone.

By default, Spring Boot creates applications with embedded web servers, which means that the server is embedded within the application code itself, so you don't have to run a separate web server to publish Java web applications. However, with a little configuration, you can also publish a WAR file to a separate Jetty or Tomcat servlet container (old-school application server style). Spring also uses Tomcat by default, but you can easily change this, as you'll see.

In this tutorial, you will build a simple web service with Jetty embedded. After that, you will create the same web service in Spring Boot and Jetty. Finally, you'll add JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and authorization to the web service using method-level security with Okta as the OAuth/OIDC provider.

## Install the prerequisites

Before you start, please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed (or install them now).

- [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/): or use [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) to manage and install multiple versions
- [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation): the Okta command-line interface
- [Auth0 CLI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli#installation): the Auth0 command-line interface
- [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/doc#installation): a simple tool for making HTTP requests from the command line

You will need a free Okta Developer account if you don't already have one. But you can wait until later in the tutorial and use the Okta CLI to log in or register for a new account.

Start by cloning [this tutorial's GitHub repo](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-jetty-example):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-jetty-example.git
```

The repository has several projects:

- `maven-jetty`: web service using Maven
- `gradle-jetty`: web service using Gradle
- `spring-boot-jetty-maven-no-auth`: web service using Spring Boot and Maven
- `spring-boot-jetty-maven-okta`: web service using Spring Boot and Maven secured with Okta
- `spring-boot-jetty-maven-auth0`: web service using Spring Boot and Maven secured with Auth0

## Build a simple web service with Java and Jetty

In the first part of this tutorial, you're going to create a simple web service using Maven and then Gradle. In the second half, you'll see how to upgrade this to a Spring Boot-based web service, to which you'll add JWT-based authentication and authorization using Okta and Auth0 as the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC providers.

You should have the files from the GitHub repository. Open the folder `maven-jetty` in your favorite IDE.

First, take a look at the `pom.xml` file (which is shown below). Notice the Jetty version is set in the properties block. The only project dependency is `jakarta.servlet-api`. It is scoped as `provided` because, in deployment, this package will be provided by the server container.

The Servlet API dependency used to be `javax-servlet-api`, but Java EE is no longer maintained and has been migrated into `jakarta.servlet-api`. This happened when Java EE moved from Oracle to the Eclipse Foundation and became Jakarta EE. As you'll see in the servlet code, this package provides the standardized classes and annotations used to build the servlet.

The packaging type for the project is `war`, not `jar`, and the Maven War plugin has been included in the build dependencies (`maven-war-plugin`).

Lastly, the Jetty Maven plugin has also been included. You can peruse [the docs here](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/jetty-11/programming-guide/index.html#jetty-maven-plugin). It is designed to make the development and testing of Jetty servlets easy by adding Maven goals to run and test the app.

</project>
```

The next file to look at is the `AhoyServlet` class.

`src/main/java/com/demo/AhoyServlet.java`

```java
package com.demo;

import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;

@WebServlet(name = "AhoyServlet", urlPatterns = {"ahoy"}, loadOnStartup = 1)
public class AhoyServlet extends HttpServlet {

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws IOException {
        response.getWriter().print("Ahoy!");
    }

}
```

This file is the most basic, bare-bones web service. In the code, you're using the `@WebServlet` annotation to define a web servlet without having to define it in a `web.xml` file. You can see [the docs here](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/4.0/apidocs/javax/servlet/annotation/webservlet) for the annotation.

Run the service from a Bash shell using the following command (run from the `jetty-maven` project root directory).

```bash
./mvnw jetty:run
```

You should see some output that looks like the following.

```bash
[INFO] Configuring Jetty for project: demo
[INFO] Classes = /home/.../jetty-update/maven-jetty/target/classes
[INFO] Context path = /
[INFO] Tmp directory = /home/.../jetty-update/maven-jetty/target/tmp

[INFO] Started Server@42e4e589{STARTING}[11.0.15,sto=0] @2490ms
```

Using HTTPie, test the simple service.

```bash
http :8080/ahoy
```

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 5
Date: Tue, 25 Apr 2023 15:22:24 GMT
Server: Jetty(11.0.15)

Ahoy!
```

That's the simplest case.

A little side note. The Maven Jetty plugin provides two tasks for running the app without building a WAR: `jetty:run` and `jetty:start`. The one you want to use is `jetty-run`. From the Jetty docs:

> `jetty:run` and `jetty:start` are alike in that they both run an unassembled webapp in Jetty, however `jetty:run` is designed to be used at the command line, whereas `jetty:start` is specifically designed to be bound to execution phases in the build lifecycle. `jetty:run` will pause Maven while Jetty is running, echoing all output to the console, and then stop Maven when Jetty exits. `jetty:start` will not pause Maven, will write all its output to a file, and will not stop Maven when Jetty exits.

Now take a look at a more fully-featured web service.

`src/main/java/com/demo/HikesTodoServlet.java`
```java
package com.demo;

import java.io.IOException;

import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

@WebServlet(name = "HikesTodoServlet", urlPatterns = {"hikes"}, loadOnStartup = 1)
public class HikesTodoServlet extends HttpServlet {

    // Not synchronized
    private List<String> hikes = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(
        "Wonderland Trail", "South Maroon Peak", "Tour du Mont Blanc",
        "Teton Crest Trail", "Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass", "Kesugi Ridge"
    ));

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws IOException {
        response.getWriter().print(String.join("\n", this.hikes));
    }

    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws IOException {
        String hike = request.getParameter("hike");
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            response.getWriter().print("Param 'hike' cannot be null.");
        } else if (this.hikes.contains(hike)) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            response.getWriter().print("The hike '" + hike + "' already exists.");
        } else {
            this.hikes.add(hike);
            response.getWriter().print(String.join("\n", this.hikes));
        }
    }

    protected void doDelete(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws IOException {
        String hike = request.getParameter("hike");
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            response.getWriter().print("Param 'hike' cannot be null.");
        } else {
            this.hikes.remove(hike);
            response.getWriter().print(String.join("\n", this.hikes));
        }
    }

}
```

This is a web app that tracks a list of hikes. It demonstrates how to support POST and DELETE operations, as well as simple GETs and some simple error handling.

If your local Jetty server is still running, you can go ahead and test it. Otherwise, start it again using the `./mvnw jetty:run` command.

```bash
http :8080/hikes
```
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
```

POST a new hike:

```bash
http -f POST :8080/hikes hike="Pear Lake"
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
```

Delete a hike:

```bash
http DELETE :8080/hikes hike=="South Maroon Peak"
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 110
Date: Tue, 25 Apr 2023 15:25:26 GMT
Server: Jetty(11.0.15)

Wonderland Trail
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
```

Now try to delete a hike that doesn't exist or send an empty value:

```bash
http DELETE :8080/hikes
```

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
...

Param 'hike' cannot be null.
```

That's how you can create a web service using Maven and Jetty. To deploy this, you would typically build the packaged WAR file using `mvn package` and deploy the WAR to your Jetty server.

Stop the Jetty server by pressing `Ctrl-C` in the terminal window where it's running.

> **NOTE:** this is a very naive implementation of a REST service. It uses an in-memory `ArrayList` as a data source, which is not synchronized (and thus would run into threading problems in a real web servlet). For anything beyond the scope of this tutorial, you'd need to implement a database backend of some kind. For help on how to do this, see the example blog posts listed at the end of the tutorial. You would typically also add a PUT endpoint and assign each item an ID to use as an index so data can be updated, but that is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

## Build a web service with Gradle and Jetty

Next, you're going to look at how you can accomplish the same thing you did above, but this time with Gradle instead of Maven. Why? Because some people are allergic to XML and love DSLs instead.

The Gradle-based app is located in the `gradle-jetty` subdirectory.

[Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) is a Groovy-based build system that uses a custom DSL (domain-specific language) for its build files. Because the build script files are essentially Groovy scripts, the build system is incredibly powerful, thus, very flexible.

To run a Jetty server using Gradle, you'll use [the Gretty plugin](https://github.com/gretty-gradle-plugin/gretty).

From the Gretty docs:

> Gretty is a feature-rich Gradle plugin for running web apps on embedded servlet containers. It supports Jetty versions 10, Tomcat versions 10, multiple web apps, and many more. It wraps servlet  container functions as convenient Gradle tasks and configuration DSL

This project uses Gretty plugin version 4.0.3, which uses Jetty version 11.0.11. Since version 4, Gretty requires `jakarta` imports over `javax`. You can use Gretty 3 if you want to support non-Jakarta apps (this is explained on the Gretty GitHub page above).

The two Java servlet classes are the same in both projects. I did find that Gretty and Gradle crashed unless I added an empty `src/main/webapp` directory (this wasn't necessary with Maven).

The `build.gradle` file is analogous to the `pom.xml` file.

```bash
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'war'
    id 'org.gretty' version '4.0.3'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    providedCompile 'jakarta.servlet:jakarta.servlet-api:6.0.0'
}

gretty {
    contextPath = '/'
}
```

This is about as simple as it gets. The same Jakarta-based servlet API is included as a provided dependency, and the Gretty plugin is included in the `plugins` block.

The context path is configured to be the root path. If you want to see the other configuration properties, take a look at [the Gretty configuration docs](https://gretty-gradle-plugin.github.io/gretty-doc/Gretty-configuration.html).

You can also look at the Gradle tasks that the plugin adds [in the docs](https://gretty-gradle-plugin.github.io/gretty-doc/Gretty-tasks.html).

To run the web app, use the `appRun` task.

```bash
./gradlew appRun
```

You can test the two endpoints: `/hikes` and `/ahoy`.

```bash
$ http :8080/hikes
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge

$ http :8080/ahoy
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Ahoy!
```

You've seen how to build a web service using Jetty in both Gradle and Maven. Next, you'll build one using Spring Boot and Maven.

## Build a web service with Spring Boot and Jetty

By default, Spring Boot is configured to use an embedded Tomcat server. However, this is easily configurable. The [Spring Boot docs on embedded web servers](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto.webserver) is a good resource. To switch to Jetty, you need to do two things:

1. disable the default embedded Tomcat server
2. enable an embedded Jetty server

This is done in the `pom.xml` file by these two dependency configuration blocks. The first removes the Tomcat dependency from `spring-boot-starter-web-no-auth`, and the second adds the `spring-boot-starter-jetty` dependency.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <!-- Exclude the Tomcat dependency -->
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
<!-- Use Jetty instead -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jetty</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Here is the full `pom.xml`. Notice the Spring Boot version is 3.0.6 and the Jakarta Servlet version is set to 5.0.0. This is because Jetty does not yet support Servlet 6.0.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

    <properties>
        <java.version>17</java.version>
        <!-- Required since Jetty 11 does not yet support Servlet 6.0 -->
        <jakarta-servlet.version>5.0.0</jakarta-servlet.version>
    </properties>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
            <exclusions>
                <!-- Exclude the Tomcat dependency -->
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
            </exclusions>
        </dependency>
        <!-- Use Jetty instead -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jetty</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>

</project>
```

In this case, you're no longer using the `@WebServlet` annotation. Instead, you're using the Spring MVC API. The web controller is contained in a class named `WebController`.

`src/main/java/com/demo/WebController.java`
```java
package com.demo;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

@Controller
@RequestMapping(path = "/hikes")
public class WebController {

    private List<String> hikes = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(
        "Wonderland Trail", "South Maroon Peak", "Tour du Mont Blanc",
        "Teton Crest Trail", "Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass", "Kesugi Ridge"
    ));

    @GetMapping()
    @ResponseBody
    public String indexGet() {
        return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
    }

    @PostMapping()
    @ResponseBody
    public String indexPost(@RequestParam String hike, HttpServletResponse response) {
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "Param 'hike' cannot be null.";
        } else if (this.hikes.contains(hike)) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "The hike '" + hike + "' already exists.";
        } else {
            this.hikes.add(hike);
            return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
        }
    }

    @DeleteMapping()
    @ResponseBody
    public String indexDelete(@RequestParam String hike, HttpServletResponse response) {
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "Param 'hike' cannot be null.";
        } else {
            this.hikes.remove(hike);
            return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
        }
    }

}
```

To run the Spring Boot app, open a Bash shell and navigate to the `spring-boot-jetty-maven-no-auth` subdirectory.

Run the following.

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Wait for it to finish initializing.

```bash
...
2023-04-25T09:53:15.228-06:00  INFO 57678 --- [           main] o.s.b.web.embedded.jetty.JettyWebServer  : Jetty started on port(s) 8080 (http/1.1) with context path '/'
2023-04-25T09:53:15.231-06:00  INFO 57678 --- [           main] com.demo.SpringBootJettyApplication      : Started SpringBootJettyApplication in 0.683 seconds (process running for 0.831)
```

Test it with HTTPie.

```bash
http :8080/hikes
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
```

This web service has the same features as the `@WebServlet` version: GET, POST, and DELETE, but no PUT.

## Deploy the Spring Boot project

You now have a Spring Boot application that runs on an embedded Jetty container. To deploy it to a production server, build an executable jar file using `./mvnw package`, copy this jar file (found in the `target` directory) to the server, and run it using `java -jar <your jar file name>.jar`. There's no need for a separate web server since this jar contains an embedded Jetty web server.

For example, for this project. First, build the JAR.

```bash
./mvnw package -DskipTests
```

Now run the JAR.

```bash
java -jar target/SpringBootJetty-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

> **NOTE:** For a more old-school deployment to an application server with multiple separate applications on the same server, you need to build a war file. [The Spring docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto.traditional-deployment) on how to do this are a great resource. Essentially you need to do two things: 1) add the `war` plugin to the project dependencies, and 2) change the Jetty or Tomcat dependency to `providedRuntime` so it's not included in the packaged war. Then you build a war file and deploy it to the servlet web app path on the server.

In the next section, you will use Spring Security and Okta to protect the POST and DELETE endpoints.

## Use the Okta CLI to create an OIDC application

The first step to securing the app is configuring an OpenID Connect (OIDC) app on Okta. OpenID Connect is an identity authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0, an authorization protocol. In short, OIDC is how the app verifies who the user is, and OAuth 2.0 is how the app verifies what the user is allowed to do. Spring Security provides the client-side implementation and, in this example, you'll be using Okta as the cloud provider.

You need to run the following commands from the `spring-boot-jetty-maven-okta` subdirectory.

{% include setup/cli.md type="web" framework="Okta Spring Boot Starter" loginRedirectUri="https://oidcdebugger.com/debug,http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta" logoutRedirectUri="https://oidcdebugger.com/,http://localhost:8080/" %}

> **NOTE:** You will use the oidcdebugger.com redirect URI to create an access token you can use from the command line with HTTPie. The second URI is the default redirect URI that Spring Security uses for Okta when using its OAuth login feature.

## Configure the Spring Boot app for Okta

The project uses [the Okta Spring Boot Starter](https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot) to simplify configure Spring Security. Find the following block in the `pom.xml` file and uncomment it.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.okta.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>okta-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Confirm that your issuer URI, client ID, and client secret were added to the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

```properties
okta.oauth2.issuer=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.clientId={clientId}
okta.oauth2.clientSecret={clientSecret}
```

The `SpringBootJettyApplication` class is where the security is configured. It looks like the following. It enables JWT-based OAuth and OIDC security. However, it explicitly allows any request. You are doing this because you are going to use method-level security.

```java
package com.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;

@Configuration
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootJettyApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootJettyApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeHttpRequests((authz) -> {
            authz.anyRequest().permitAll();
        });
        http.oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();

        return http.build();
    }

}
```

### Protect the DELETE and POST endpoints

The `@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated")` annotation has been added to the `indexPost()` and `indexDelete()` methods in the `WebController` class. This requires that each request to those endpoints be authenticated -- that is, a valid user will need to be logged in. Because you are using Okta as your OIDC provider, they will be able to have authenticated with Okta's servers, typically through a single sign-on.

Update the `WebController` to the following.

`src/main/java/com/demo/WebController.java`

```java
package com.demo;

import org.springframework.security.access.prepost.PreAuthorize;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

@Controller
@RequestMapping(path = "/hikes")
public class WebController {

    private List<String> hikes = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(
        "Wonderland Trail", "South Maroon Peak", "Tour du Mont Blanc",
        "Teton Crest Trail", "Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass", "Kesugi Ridge"
    ));

    @GetMapping("")
    @ResponseBody
    public String indexGet() {
        return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
    }

    @PostMapping("")
    @ResponseBody
    @PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated")  // <- ***ADDED***
    public String indexPost(@RequestParam String hike, HttpServletResponse response) {
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "Param 'hike' cannot be null.";
        } else if (this.hikes.contains(hike)) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "The hike '" + hike + "' already exists.";
        } else {
            this.hikes.add(hike);
            return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
        }
    }

    @DeleteMapping("")
    @ResponseBody
    @PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated")  // <- ***ADDED***
    public String indexDelete(@RequestParam String hike, HttpServletResponse response) {
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "Param 'hike' cannot be null.";
        } else {
            this.hikes.remove(hike);
            return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
        }
    }

}
```

From the `spring-boot-jetty-maven-okta` subdirectory, open a shell and start the app.

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

From a different shell, try to POST a new hike:

```bash
http -f POST :8080/hikes hike="Pear Lake"
```

```bash
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
...

{
    "error": "Forbidden",
    "path": "/hikes",
    "status": 403,
    "timestamp": "2023-04-25T16:17:37.214+00:00"
}
```

### Generate a JWT using the OIDC Debugger

To access the protected endpoints, you need to generate an access token JWT. {% include setup/oidcdebugger.md %}

{% img blog/java-jetty/oidc-debugger.png alt:"OIDC Debugger Configuration" width:"650" %}{: .center-image }

Scroll down and click **Send Request**.

{% img blog/java-jetty/oidc-debugger-success.jpg alt:"OIDC Debugger Success" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Copy the access token to your clipboard and store it in a shell variable in the shell window you use to make requests.

```
TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJIb05xb01mNE9jREltWnBGRnBINjZGTkFOM0J... 
```

Now try and POST a new hike and then remove it.

```bash
http -f POST :8080/hikes hike="Pear Lake" "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
```

```bash
http DELETE :8080/hikes hike=="South Maroon Peak" "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
```

## Secure the Spring Boot app with Auth0

You can also use Auth0 to secure the Spring Boot application. Look at the project in the `spring-boot-jetty-maven-auth0` subdirectory. Similar to the Okta project, this project uses [the Okta Spring Boot Starter](https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot) to simplify configuring Spring Security. Find the following block in the `pom.xml` file and uncomment it.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.okta.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>okta-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Support for Auth0 was added in [version 3.0.3](https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/releases/tag/okta-spring-boot-parent-3.0.3) of the Okta Spring Boot starter.

If you look in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file, you'll see that there are two properties: the issuer URI and the audience.

```properties
okta.oauth2.issuer=https://<your-auth0-domain>/
okta.oauth2.audience=https://<your-auth0-domain>/api/v2/
```

Install the [Auth0 CLI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli) and run `auth0 login` in a terminal.

You need to find your Auth0 domain. One way to do this is to use the following command.

```bash
auth0 tenants list
```

```bash
=== dev-0rb77jrp.us.auth0.com 

  AVAILABLE TENANTS          
  dev-0rb77jrp.us.auth0.com  
```

Take the above domain and replace the placeholder in the `okta.oauth2.issuer` property in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file. **Don't remove the trailing slash!**

```properties
okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-0rb77jrp.us.auth0.com/
okta.oauth2.audience=https://dev-0rb77jrp.us.auth0.com/api/v2/
```

The app is configured, and you can go ahead and run it.

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

To test the app, you need to open a new Bash shell in the same project subdirectory.

Just like with Okta, you can list the hikes without a JWT.

```bash
http :8080/hikes
...
Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
```

However, if you try and add or delete a hike, you'll need a token.

Use the Auth0 CLI to create a valid access token for testing.

```bash
auth0 test token -a https://<your-auth0-domain>/api/v2/
```

Select the `Default App [Generic]` to continue.

Save the token in a shell variable.

```bas
TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZ...
```

Add a new hike using the token.

```bash
http -f POST :8080/hikes hike="Pear Lake" "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
```

That's it. Auth0 security is working!
