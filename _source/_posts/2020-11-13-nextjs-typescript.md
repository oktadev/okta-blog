Next.js is a React framework that aims to provide the best development experience. It is feature rich, including hybrid static and server rendering, TypeScript support, built-in CSS support, API routers, and much more.

TypeScript is an open-source language that is built on JavaScript that allows developers to use types. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use TypeScript with Next.js.  

Finally, you will secure your application with Okta Single Sign-On and the built-in functionality of Next.js, as well as the support of the next-auth package.  

## Create Your Okta Application

The first thing you will need to do is create an [Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) if you don't have one already. The account is free, doesn't require a credit card, and allows you to start with Okta immediately. Once you have signed up, log in to the Developer Console and click on **Applications**. Click **Add Application** and select **Web**. In your application settings screen set your URIs to `localhost:3000` instead of the default `localhost:8080`. Next, set your **Login redirect URIs** to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/okta`. This is the default callback URI that `next-auth` will use. Give your application a meaningful name, I named mine *NextJs*. Click **Done** and you will be brought to your application's management screen. Click on **General** and note your *Client ID* and *Client secret* as you will need these in your application.

## Create Your Next.js Application

Open your favorite IDE. For this tutorial, I used Visual Studio Code. Navigate to the folder where you wish to keep your application. Next, use the `create-next-app` task runner by using the command `npx create-next-app` and follow the instructions. After the runner is complete, open the folder it created for you.

Since you are using TypeScript in this tutorial you will need to set up TypeScript support. Create a new file in the root of your application called `tsconfig.json`. Next.js will automatically populate this file with its default values but you can edit them if you wish. Next, run `npm run dev` in your console and you will see instructions about installing your dependencies for TypeScript.

To do this, open the console and run the following commands.

```console
npm i typescript@4.0.3
npm i @types/node@14.11.8
npm i @types/react@16.9.52    
```

This will complete your TypeScript setup. But there are more dependencies you should add at this point. You can add `next-auth` at this point. Next-auth makes setting up any type of authentication in Next.js simple. Of course, for this application, you are only setting up Okta as an external provider. Install next-auth with the command below and you will see how to implement it later.

```console
npm i next-auth@3.1.0
```

Finally, for this tutorial, you will use Bootstrap for your CSS framework.  

```console
 npm i bootstrap@4.5.3
```

### Convert Your Next.js Application to TypeScript

The task running for creating a Next.js application does not include an option for using TypeScript. Therefore you will need to manually convert your application from JavaScript to TypeScript. The process is simple and should only take a moment.  

You have already completed the first two steps by setting up your `tsconfig.json` file and installing your dependencies. Now you will need to convert files with the `.js` extension to `.tsx`. You will need to do this for each file in your `pages` directory and any subdirectories. Any subsequent components you add will also need to have the `.tsx` file extension.

### Set Up Your Authentication

Next, you'll need to set up the authentication for external providers.

Before you can implement authentication, you will need to ensure that your `.env.local` file is set up correctly. Add this file to the root of your project if one doesn't exist yet. Add the following values to it.

```JSON
OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENTSECRET={yourClientSecret}
OKTA_DOMAIN={yourOktaDomain}
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Now, under your `pages\api` folder create a new folder called `auth` if one doesn't exist yet. Add a file called `[...nextauth].ts`. Add the following code to it.

```typescript
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import Providers from 'next-auth/providers'

const options = {
  // Configure one or more authentication providers
  providers: [
    Providers.Okta({
      clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENTID,
      clientSecret: process.env.OKTA_CLIENTSECRET,
      domain: process.env.OKTA_DOMAIN
    }),
    // ...add more providers here
  ]
}

export default (req, res) => NextAuth(req, res, options)
```

Finally, open `pages\_app.tsx` and replace the existing code with the following.

```typescript
import '../styles/globals.css'
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'

import { Provider } from 'next-auth/client'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <Provider session={pageProps.session}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Provider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

This code is the default Next.js code wrapped in a `Provider` class from next-auth. The provider class makes sharing the session between pages easier. You added the Bootstrap CSS in this file as well. This will enable you to use Bootstrap on your pages.


### Write Your Next.js Components and Pages

Your application is set up and ready to develop. Start by adding a new folder called `Components` to the root of your directory. This will be a folder for your shared components. Add a new file called `Movies.tsx` and add the following code.

```typescript
export default function Movies() {

    return (
        <div className="row">

            <div className="col-lg-4">

                <div className="card">
                    <img className="card-img-top" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91gDYZG%2BzDL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Card image cap"></img>
                    <div className="card-body">
                        <h5 className="card-title">Die Hard</h5>
                        <p className="card-text">He's the only chance anyone has got.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

            </div>

            <div className="col-lg-4">

                <div className="card">
                    <img className="card-img-top" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjRlNDUxZjAtOGQ4OC00OTNlLTgxNmQtYTBmMDgwZmNmNjkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_.jpg" alt="Card image cap"></img>
                    <div className="card-body">
                        <h5 className="card-title">Die Hard 2</h5>
                        <p className="card-text">They say lightning never strikes twice... They were wrong</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

            </div>

            <div className="col-lg-4">

                <div className="card">
                    <img className="card-img-top" src="https://belgianfilmfreak.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/d0.jpg" alt="Card image cap"></img>
                    <div className="card-body">
                        <h5 className="card-title">Die Hard: With a Vengence</h5>
                        <p className="card-text">Think Fast, Look Alive, Die Hard</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

This component will be displayed on the `Dashboard` page for logged-in users. It displays some of the most important movies in history to the user.

Next, you can add a file called `Unauthorized.tsx`.  

```typescript
import { signIn } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Unauthorized() {

    return (
        <div className="row">
            <div className="col-lg-10 col-offset-1">

                <p>Hey There, looks like you reached an area you don't have access to.</p>

               <p> Please sign in here.</p>

               <p> <button className="btn btn-secondary" onClick={signIn}>Sign in</button></p>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

This is the first time on the client that you are using the `next-auth` package. You are importing the `signIn` feature from the `next-auth/client` component. This function will navigate the user to a list of providers that you implemented previously. The user will then be able to click on that provider and be taken to their login screen. The `Unauthorized` component simply presents the user with a message that they reached a protected part of the site without being authenticated and routes them to the appropriate provider.

The last file to add to this folder is the `Header.tsx` file. This is just a banner that sits on top of each page and has a login or logout button depending on the state of the user.

```typescript
import { signIn, signOut, useSession } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Header() {

  const [session, loading] = useSession();

  var button;

  if (session) {
    button = <button className="btn btn-secondary" onClick={signOut}>Logout</button>;
  }
  else {
    button = <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={signIn}>Login</button>;
  }

  return (

    <div className="row mb-4">
      <div className="col-lg-12">
        <nav className="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
          <a className="navbar-brand" href="#">Home</a>

          <button className="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
            <span className="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
          </button>

          <div className="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
            <ul className="navbar-nav mr-auto">
              <li className="nav-item active">
                <a className="nav-link" href="/">Home <span className="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
              </li>
              <li className="nav-item">
                <a className="nav-link" href="dashboard">Movies</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div className="form-inline my-2 my-lg-0">
              {button}
            </div>

          </div>
        </nav>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The simplest way to see if a user is logged in is to check if the session exists by calling `useSession()` from `next-auth`. If it does, you present the user with the option to log out using the `signOut()` function. If it does not, you present the user with a login button that ties into the `signIn()` function you used on the `Unauthorized` component.  

You can tie everything together by creating your pages. By default, Next.js should have added an `index.tsx` file. (Well, really, it added `index.js` but you should have changed the extension to `.tsx` already.) You can replace the code in that file with the code below.

```typescript
import Head from 'next/head'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'

import Header from '../components/Header'

export default function Home() {

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <Head>
        <title>Movies By Nik - Find Your Next Movie</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>

      <div className="row">
        <div className="col-lg-12">
          <Header></Header>
        </div>
      </div>

}
```

Here you are giving any user a landing page to display what your site is about and using the header to provide a login button if necessary.

Finally, you need to create a dashboard page. Start by creating a new file in the `pages` directory called `dashboard.tsx`. This page will need to check if the user has access to the page and display the `Unauthorized` component if not and the `Movies` component if they are. You can add the following code to it. 

```typescript
import React from 'react'

import Head from 'next/head'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'

import Header from '../components/Header'
import Unauthorized from '../components/Unauthorized'
import Movies from '../components/Movies'

import { useSession } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Dashboard() {

    const [session, loading] = useSession();

    var content = session ? <Movies></Movies> : <Unauthorized></Unauthorized>

    return (
        <div className="container">
            <Head>
                <title>Movies By Nik - Find Your Next Movie</title>
                <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
            </Head>

            <Header></Header>

            {content}

        </div>
    )
}
```

As you learned already, the easiest way to check if a user is authenticated is to check if the `session` exists. 

## Test and Conclusions

You should be ready to start your application now. From the command line run `npm run-script dev` and navigate to *http://localhost:3000*. You should be presented with the home screen for the application.

{% img blog/nextjs-typescript/app-dashboard.png alt:"Application Dashboard" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next click on the **Movies** link. You should receive a message telling you that you don't have access to the dashboard. Click **Sign in** and select **Okta** then log in with your Okta credentials. You should be redirected to the dashboard page showing you some of the greatest movies in history.

From here you can continue to build on your react components and develop your API to support your frontend knowing that your application is safe and secure with Okta's authentication.
