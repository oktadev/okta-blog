Elasticsearch is a search engine that can be integrated into any of your tech stacks using its REST APIs and its wide selection of libraries.

By installing and integrating Elasticsearch into your system, you can add a search engine to your website, add autocomplete functionalities, use its machine learning functionalities to perform analysis on your data and provide better results for your users, and much more.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Elasticsearch into a Laravel blog. You'll also add authentication to your blog using Okta and allow authenticated users to create new blog posts.

## What is Elasticsearch?

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co) allows you to index your data and perform searches quickly and efficiently. It also allows you to better understand your data, and to track your query load times using tools like [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/), a visualization dashboard for your data .

If you have an e-commerce website, it's important to add a search engine that will allow your users to search through thousands of products, including multiple fields like titles, descriptions, and categories in the search. Elasticsearch is a versatile search engine that not only makes the process easy for you, but also indexes and [caches](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-caching-deep-dive-boosting-query-speed-one-cache-at-a-time) data to provide a faster and more optimized response to your queries.

## Integrate Elasticsearch with Laravel

In this section, you'll create a blog with [Laravel](https://laravel.com) that shows posts for unauthenticated users and allows users authenticated with [Okta](https://developer.okta.com) to add posts. Then you'll integrate Elasticsearch, adding search functionality to the blog.

You can find the code for this tutorial in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-php-laravel-elasticsearch-example).

### Prerequisites

Before you start with this tutorial, you'll need [PHP](https://www.php.net) version 7.3 or higher. If you're running Windows, you'll also need to enable the use of the SQLite3 extension by adding a DLL to the system `PATH`, following the directions in the [SQLite3 installation guide](https://www.php.net/manual/en/sqlite3.installation.php). You also need to have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) installed.

To use Elasticsearch, you need to have it installed and running on your machine. You can follow the installation steps in [this guide from Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html), and then [learn the basics here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/starting-elasticsearch.html).

If you have a fresh PHP installation, or haven't worked with Laravel before, you might need to install some extensions, such as `php-dom`, `php-zip`, and `php-curl`. For more detail on how to install any of these extensions, you can follow [this guide on how to install the PHP extensions necessary for Laravel](https://betterprogramming.pub/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-laravel-setup-6c1fd98c2670). Please note that the linked guide uses PHP version 7.3â€”if you're using PHP version 7.4, be sure to replace `7.3` in the commands with `7.4`.

### Creating your project

In your terminal, run the following command to create a Laravel 8 project:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-es '^8'
```

Navigate to the directory of the newly created project:

```bash
cd laravel-es
```

### Build your database

To manage the blog data, you'll need a database. To keep this tutorial simple, you'll be using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). Run the following command to create the database:

```bash
touch database/db.sqlite
```

Then change the database configuration in `.env`:

```
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/absolute/path/to/laravel-es/database/db.sqlite
```

For `DB_DATABASE`, make sure you set the absolute path to the SQLite database you just created.

Now you'll prepare the migrations to create the tables in the database.

By default, Laravel comes with a migration for the `users` table, which you can find in `database/migrations`. The file name should be `2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table.php`. Open the file and change the content of the `up` method:

```php
Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->bigIncrements('id');
    $table->string('email')->unique();
    $table->string('name');
    $table->text('token');
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

This change will allow you to integrate with Okta later. Because the authentication will be done through Okta, all you have to do is store the user's token, though you can also store other details, like name and email, for easy access to user details.

You also need a `posts` table. Run the following command to create a migration for it:

```bash
php artisan make:migration create_posts_table
```

This will create a new file in `database/migrations`, starting with a timestamp and ending with `create_posts_table.php`. Open the file and replace the content of the `up` method with the following:

```php
Schema::create('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('title');
    $table->longText('content');
    $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained('users')->cascadeOnUpdate()->cascadeOnDelete();
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

This will create a posts table that has the fields `id`, `title`, `content`, and `user_id`. These are the essential fields for a blog post, but you can add other fields if you wish.

Run the following command to create the tables in the database:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Create your models

Next, you need to create models that you'll use to interact with the tables in the database.

By default, Laravel has the `User` model created for you in `app/Models`. However, because you modified the migration file earlier, you also need to modify the model.

Open `app/Models/User.php` and change the content of the `User` class:

```php
protected $fillable = [
    'email', 'name', 'token'
];

protected $hidden = [
    'token'
];
```

This will change the `fillable` fields to `email`, `name`, and `token`, and will keep the token private by adding it to the `hidden` array.

Let's now create the `Post` model. Create the file `app/Models/Post.php` and add the following content:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'title', 'content', 'user_id'
    ];
}
```

The `Post` model has the fillable fields of `title`, `content`, and `user_id`.

### Create a home page for your blog

. Nearly all blogs begin with a website of some sort. You'll start by creating a home page to display all the posts that have been added to the blog.

Create the controller to handle incoming requests using this command:

```bash
php artisan make:controller BlogController
```

This will create the file `app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php`. Open it and import the class `Post` at the beginning of the file:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
```

Then add the following method inside the `BlogController` class:

```php
public function home (Request $request) {
    $posts = Post::all();

    return view('home', ['posts' => $posts]);
}
```

This retrieves the posts and sends them to the `home` view.

Now create the file `resources/views/home.blade.php` with the following content:

{% raw %}
```php
@extends('layout')

@section('content')
    @forelse ($posts as $post)
      <div class="card mt-3">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">{{ $post->title }}</h5>
          <span class="small">{{ $post->summary }}</span>
          <p class="card-text">
            {!! $post->content !!}
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    @empty
      <div class="card mt-3">
        <div class="card-body">
          There are no posts available
        </div>
      </div>
    @endforelse
@endsection
```
{% endraw %}

This code will show the posts, if there are any, viewed as cards. Notice that this extends another view, called `layout`, which you'll create now.

Make the file `resources/views/layout.blade.php` with the following content:

{% raw %}
```php

            @endguest
            @auth
              <a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#">Add Post</a>
            @endauth
          </li>
        </ul>
        @auth
          <span>{{ Auth::user()->name }}</span>
        @endauth
      </div>
    </div>
  </nav>
  <div class="container mt-4">
    @yield('content')

</body>
</html>
```
{% endraw %}

This eliminates repeated code by creating a layout view that other views can extend. For ease of styling, you're using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) to create your layout. 

All pages will have a navigation bar. When the user is not authenticated, they'll see a sign-in link. Otherwise, they'll see a link to add a post.

The last step to creating your home page is registering the new route. Open `routes/web.php` and replace the current `/` route with the following:

```php
Route::get('/', [App\Http\Controllers\BlogController::class, 'home']);
```

Let's test it out now. In your terminal, run the server with the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

This will run your server, typically on `localhost:8000`. Open it in your browser, and you'll see that there are currently no posts on your website.

{% img blog/elasticsearch-laravel/no-posts-available.png alt:"There are no posts available" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }


### Add authentication with Okta

You're going to add user authentication to your website using [Okta](https://developer.okta.com). 

#### Set up Okta

If you don't already have an Okta account, go ahead and [create one](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)â€”otherwise, just log in. From the sidebar, click **Applications**, then **Applications** in the sub-menu. After that, click on **Create App Integration**.

In the pop-up, select **OIDC - OpenID Connect** and **Web Application**, then click **Next**.

{% img blog/elasticsearch-laravel/create-new-app-integration.jpg alt:"Create new app integration" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, on the page that opens, you'll enter details about the new integration. In the first section, you need to enter the app's name. For **Grant Type**, choose **Client Credentials**, and for **Sign-in redirect URIs**, enter http://localhost:8000/login/redirect. Later, this is where you'll handle the authentication.

{% img blog/elasticsearch-laravel/configure-app.png alt:"Configure app settings" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

At the bottom of the form, under **Assignments**, choose **Allow everyone in your organization to access**. This allows any user in your Okta organization to log in to the blog.

Once you're done, click on **Save**. You'll be redirected to the page of the app you just created. On that page, you can see **Client ID** and **Client Secret** keys. Copy them and add them as new keys in `.env`:

```
OKTA_BASE_URL=
OKTA_CLIENT_ID=
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=
OKTA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/login/redirect
```

The last thing you need is your organization's Okta base URL, which can be found by going to **Security**, then **API**. It'll be in the table under **Issuer URI**. You only need the authority, not the full path.

{% img blog/elasticsearch-laravel/get-base-uri.png alt:"Get the base URI from the issuer URI" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Okta is now ready to be used for authentication!

#### Add authentication in Laravel

Back in Laravel, you'll add the authentication with Okta by using [Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/socialite). Socialite allows you to add social logins, as well as OAuth providers like Okta, to your Laravel app.

Install the package for authentication with Okta using Socialite:

```bash
composer require laravel/socialite socialiteproviders/okta
```

After installing the package, you need to add Okta in the `config/services.php` so that Socialite can find and use its keys:

```php
'okta' => [    
        'base_url' => env('OKTA_BASE_URL'),
        'client_id' => env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'),  
        'client_secret' => env('OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET'),  
        'redirect' => env('OKTA_REDIRECT_URI'),
        'auth_server_id' => env('OKTA_SERVER_ID')
      ],
```

You also need to configure Socialite's listener to listen to the `SocialiteWasCalled` event to use Okta. In `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php` add the event in the `$listen` array inside the `EventServiceProvider` class:

```php
$listen = [
  ...,
  \SocialiteProviders\Manager\SocialiteWasCalled::class => [
              \SocialiteProviders\Okta\OktaExtendSocialite::class.'@handle',
        ],
]
```

You can now use Socialite to authenticate with Okta.
Start by first importing the `Socialite` facade at the beginning of `app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php`:

```php
use Laravel\Socialite\Facades\Socialite;
```

Then add a new method in the `BlogController` class:

```php
public function redirectToLogin () {
    return Socialite::driver('okta')->redirect();
}
```

When the user clicks the **Sign In** link in the navigation bar, they'll be taken into the `login` page in your Laravel blog, which is handled by `redirectToLogin`. On the `login` page, Socialite will make use of the keys you added to `.env` to redirect users to Okta's authentication page.

Add the route to this `login` route in `routes/web.php`:

{% raw %}
```php
Route::get('/login', [App\Http\Controllers\BlogController::class, 'redirectToLogin'])->name('login');
```
{% endraw %}

Change the URL of the **Sign In** link in `resources/views/layout.blade.php`:

{% raw %}
```php
<a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="{{ route('login') }}">Sign In</a>
```
{% endraw %}

Now when you open the home page again and click the **Sign In** link in the navigation bar, you'll be taken to Okta's authentication screen.

{% img blog/elasticsearch-laravel/okta-login-prompt.png alt:"Okta login prompt" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }

Before you can test the authentication, you need to add the redirect route that will handle the response of the successful authentication.

In `app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php`, add the necessary import at the beginning of the file for `Auth`, which you'll be using for authentication:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use App\Models\User;
```

Then, add the following method inside the `BlogController` class:

```php
public function handleLogin () {
    $oktaUser = Socialite::driver('okta')->user();

    $user = User::where('email', $oktaUser->email)->first();

    if (!$user) {
        $user = User::create([
            'email' => $oktaUser->email,
            'name'  => $oktaUser->name,
            'token' => $oktaUser->token,
        ]);
    } else {
        $user->token = $oktaUser->token;
        $user->save();
    }

    try {
        Auth::login($user);
    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        return redirect()->route('login');
    }

    return redirect('/');
}
```

This tells Socialite to retrieve the Okta user, then checks if the user's email address is in the database. If it is, the `token` field is changed to reflect the user's token. If it isn't, a new user is created, and the `token` field updates with their information. The user is then authenticated on your Laravel blog using `Auth::login` and is redirected to the home page.

Next, add the route in `routes/web.php`:

```php
Route::get('/login/redirect', [App\Http\Controllers\BlogController::class, 'handleLogin']);
```

You can now test the authentication. Fill out the Okta form with your name and password. 

After logging in, you'll be redirected to the home page, and you'll see that the link in the navigation bar has changed to **Add Post**. You'll also see your name on the right side of the navigation bar.

{% img blog/elasticsearch-laravel/logged-in.png alt:"Logged-in dashboard view" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

### Add your post page

Now that users can log in, you'll need to add a page where authenticated users can create new blog posts.

Create the file `resources/views/post-form.blade.php` with the following content:

{% raw %}
```php
@extends('layout')

@section('content')
    <form method="POST" action="#">
      <h1>New Post</h1>
      @csrf
      <div class="mb-3">
        <label for="title" class="form-label">Title</label>
        <input type="text" class="form-control" id="title" name="title">
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        <label for="content" class="form-label">Content</label>
        <textarea id="content" name="content"></textarea>
      </div>
      <div class="text-center">
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>
@endsection

@push('scripts')
  <script src="https://cdn.tiny.cloud/1/no-api-key/tinymce/5/tinymce.min.js" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
  <script>
    tinymce.init({
      selector: '#content'
    });
  </script>
@endpush
```
{% endraw %}

This will create the new post form, with a textbox to add the title and a [tinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/) rich text editor to add the content.

Add the new route in `routes/web.php`:

```php
Route::get('/post/new', function () {
    return view('post-form');
})->name('post.new.form')->middleware('auth');
```

Change the URL of the **Add Post** link in the navigation bar in `resources/views/layout.blade.php`:

{% raw %}
```php
<a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="{{ route('post.new.form') }}">Add Post</a>
```
{% endraw %}

If you go to the home page and click on **Add Post**, you'll be taken to the form you just created.

{% img blog/elasticsearch-laravel/new-post-page.png alt:"New post page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

To add the form POST request handler route, add the following to `app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php`:

{% raw %}
```php
public function savePost (Request $request) {
    //save post
    $user = Auth::user();

    $post = new Post([
        'title' => $request->get('title'),
        'content' => $request->get('content'),
        'user_id' => $user->id
    ]);
    $post->save();

    return redirect('/');
}
```
{% endraw %}

This will save the new post and redirect you back to the home page.

Add the new route in `routes/web.php`:

```php
Route::post('/post/new', [App\Http\Controllers\BlogController::class, 'savePost'])->name('post.new')->middleware('auth');
```

Change the value for the `action` attribute of the form in `post-form.blade.php`:

{% raw %}
```php
<form method="POST"  action="{{ route('post.new') }}">
```
{% endraw %}

Open the page with the **Add Post** form again, enter a title and body content, then submit the form. You'll be redirected to the home page, which will now display the post you added.

### Add search functionality

The last part of this project is adding a search bar and integrating it with Elasticsearch to index data and fetch results.

You'll need to install the `laravel-elasticsearch` package, which wraps Elasticsearch's PHP package so it can be used easily in Laravel:

```bash
composer require cviebrock/laravel-elasticsearch
```

Add configurations to connect to the Elasticsearch server on your machine.

In `.env` add the following new keys:

```
ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=127.0.0.1
ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200
ELASTICSEARCH_SCHEME=http
ELASTICSEARCH_USER=
ELASTICSEARCH_PASS=
```

These are the default configuration values for Elasticsearch configurations, and will set the host, port, and scheme, as well as user and password, if you choose to configure them.

Use the following command to create a command in Laravel that will allow you to easily index the data:

```bash
php artisan make:command IndexPosts
```

Then open `app/Console/Commands/IndexPosts.php` and change `$signature`:

```bash
protected $signature = 'index:posts';
```

Add `use` statements before the `IndexPost` class:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Elasticsearch;
```

And change the content of `handle`:

```php
$posts = Post::all();

foreach ($posts as $post) {
    try {
        Elasticsearch::index([
            'id' => $post->id,
            'index' => 'posts',
            'body' => [
                'title' => $post->title,
                'content' => $post->content
            ]
        ]);
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        $this->info($e->getMessage());
    }
}

$this->info("Posts were successfully indexed");
```

This will loop through the posts on the blog, then index the data in Elasticsearch. All posts will be indexed under the `posts` index, and the body will include the title and content of the post. This means that both the `title` and `content` fields are searchable.

In your console, run the following command:

```php
php artisan index:posts
```

You should see a message that posts were successfully indexed.

Finally, you'll add a search bar to the home page so users can search the posts. In `resources/views/home.blade.php`, add the following before the `@forelse` loop:

{% raw %}
```php
<form method="GET" action="/">
  @csrf
  <div class="mb-3">
    <input type="search" class="form-control" id="q" name="q" value={{ request()->get('q', '') }}>
  </div>
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Search</button>
</form>
```
{% endraw %}

Then, in `app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php`, change the `home` method to the following:

```php
public function home (Request $request) {
    $q = $request->get('q');
    if ($q) {
        $response = Elasticsearch::search([
            'index' => 'posts',
            'body'  => [
                'query' => [
                    'multi_match' => [
                        'query' => $q,
                        'fields' => [
                            'title',
                            'content'
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]);

        $postIds = array_column($response['hits']['hits'], '_id');
        $posts = Post::query()->findMany($postIds);
    } else {
        $posts = Post::all();
    }

    return view('home', ['posts' => $posts]);
}
```

This change will retrieve the search term from the parameter `q`. If it's found, the search is run using Elasticsearch's `search` method. This method receives an array that accepts the `index` key for the name of the index to search through. It also accepts the `body` key, which holds the [Elasticsearch query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html). In the query, you can use the `multi_match` option to search multiple fields; in this example our fields are `title` and `content`.

The post IDs are retrieved from the response, and the associated post models are sent to the `home` view.

Remember to add the `use` statement at the beginning of the file to use `Elasticsearch`:

```php
use Elasticsearch;
