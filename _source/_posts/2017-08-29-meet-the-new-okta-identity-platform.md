I'm genuinely excited to announce that today, we're officially re-launching
the *new and improved* [Okta Identity Platform](https://developer.okta.com/).

{% img blog/authentication-still-sucks/okta-developer-screenshot.png alt:"Okta Developer Screenshot" %}

Everything has been molded to our vision, and we're aiming to do something we
could not before: build the world's largest authentication-as-a-service platform
for developers of all shapes and sizes.

The new Okta Identity Platform is our attempt to make authentication and
authorization problems a relic of the past. We want to provide beautiful
developer libraries across every programming language and framework to make
adding things like...

- User registration
- User login
- Password reset
- Social login
- Single Sign-On
- API authentication
- And lots more

...a thoughtless five minute task.

Okta handles things like user credential storage, password hashing, data
isolation, best practices, etc. If you use one of our new [developer
libraries](https://developer.okta.com/documentation/), we'll do our very best to
solve all your user management problems.

While the Okta service isn't perfect, and certainly has some rough edges, it's
something we're all incredibly passionate about, and working hard every single
day to improve. It will get better.

We won't be satisfied until Okta fills the void that exists in the web world
right now, and provides the absolute best platform for developers of all
different types to scratch their user management itch.

This means we're building the service to cater to actual developers of all
types: students, hobbyists, 10pm - 4am hackers (like myself), startups, and even
large enterprises. We're aiming to build an extremely low-cost, usage-based
service that anyone can use without the need to commit to expensive plans and
upsells. We want to make something that WE would want to use in our next passion
project.

For applications with fewer than 1,000 active monthly users, this means the
service will be absolutely free. For applications with more active users than
that, we've got inexpensive usage-based plans.

We'll be doing our absolute best to build something that we hope you will love
as well.

If you're interested in trying out the new Okta Identity Platform that
we've been working on, please [sign up today](https://developer.okta.com) and
[hit us up](https://twitter.com/oktadev) if you've got questions, comments, or
feedback.

Finally, if you'd like to read along with the entire story of how we got here,
you can read my [personal thoughts](https://www.rdegges.com/2017/authentication-still-sucks/)
