Cryptocurrencies are all the rage. Over the last year, the value of Bitcoin alone has risen 1,603%, driving more and more people to wonder if they're missing out on the "next big thing." Because of the massive influx of money into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, and Ripple &mdash; blockchain technology (which is the foundation of all cryptocurrency) has become an area of intense technical study. At its core, blockchain technology does nothing more than maintain a decentralized log of transactions that can be easily shared across many nodes (miners).

In this post, I'll show you how to add authentication to an Ionic progressive web app (PWA). PWAs are more developer-friendly to distribute than mobile apps. Not only that, but I'll show you how to use cloud services like Okta and Firebase to make things even simpler.

Josh Morony is someone I've followed ever since I got into Ionic. After developing my first app using [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com), I bought and read his book on [Building Mobile Apps with Ionic](https://www.joshmorony.com/building-mobile-apps-with-ionic-2/). He's a good marketer, and I've been receiving his newsletter ever since. As a developer, I get a lot of emails, and I usually delete the newsletter emails because most don't provide value. I've never deleted Josh's, and I started receiving it years ago. He does a great job of providing valuable information to developers!

About a month ago, I received an email from Josh advertising his Crypto PWA series of articles, which were excellent (as I expected). I highly recommend you check out Part 1: [Building a Cryptocurrency Price Tracker PWA in Ionic](https://www.joshmorony.com/building-a-cryptocurrency-price-tracker-pwa-in-ionic/).

You can also see his finished app at <https://cryptopwa.com> and find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/joshuamorony/ionic-crypto-pwa).
I thought it'd be fun to add authentication to Josh's app and show you how I did it. It wasn't too hard thanks to the fact that Ionic uses Angular and it has excellent OIDC support &mdash; thanks to [Manfred Steyer's](https://twitter.com/manfredsteyer) awesome [angular-oauth2-oidc](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc) library.

## Setup the Crypto PWA

To begin, clone Josh's finished repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuamorony/ionic-crypto-pwa.git
cd ionic-crypto-pwa
npm install
```

Optional: upgrade all the app's dependencies using [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates).

```
npm install -g npm-check-updates
ncu -u
npm install
```

Install Ionic so you'll be able to run the app.

```bash
npm install -g ionic
```

Run the app so you can see its basic functionality before adding authentication.

You can verify it works offline &mdash; like a PWA should &mdash; by toggling offline mode in your browser (in Chrome: Developer Tools > Network > Offline).

**NOTE:** This application is designed specifically to be a PWA, not for packaging as a native app and deploying to a phone. For this reason, I don't account for developing and deploying it as a mobile app in this post. If you're interested in that, please see the other articles at the end of this post.

## Add Okta for Authentication

Happily, the hardest part of using Okta is [creating a developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/), so you'll need to start there. Within 2-3 minutes, you should be able to log in to our developer console and create new applications. Follow the steps below to create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) application that allows you to authenticate with your Okta accounts.

* Log in to your Okta account and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**
* Select **SPA** and click **Next**
* Give your application a name (e.g. "Crypto PWA")
* Add the following values for **Base URI** and **Login redirect URI**:
  * `http://localhost:8100` (for development)
  * `https://<name-of-your-choosing>.firebaseapp.com` (for production)
* Click **Done** to continue. You should see settings like the following:

{% img blog/cryptocurrency-pwa/oidc-settings.png alt:"Okta OIDC Settings" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

For global logout to work, you'll need to edit your application and add `http://localhost:8080` (and optionally, your production URI) as a **Logout redirect URI**.

## Add Angular OIDC Support

At this point, I tried adding [Okta's Angular SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/tree/master/packages/okta-angular) using `npm install @okta/okta-angular`. However, I quickly discovered this library doesn't work with Ionic because it has a dependency on Angular Router, which Ionic doesn't use. You can track this issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js/issues/84).

I knew that [angular-oauth2-oidc](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc) worked based on [a previous tutorial](/blog/2017/08/22/build-an-ionic-app-with-user-authentication), so I installed angular-oauth2-oidc. Please do the same if you're following along.

```bash
npm install angular-oauth2-oidc
```

In `src/app/app.module.ts`, import `OAuthModule`.

```typescript
import { OAuthModule } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';

@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...
    OAuthModule.forRoot()
  ],
  ...
})
```

### Create a Login Page

Generate a login page by running the following command:

```bash
ionic g page Login
```

Modify `src/app/app.component.ts` to use `oauthService` to check for a valid ID token and choose the appropriate page to display.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { OAuthService } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';

@Component({
  templateUrl: 'app.html'
})
export class MyApp {
  rootPage: any = 'HomePage';

  constructor(oauthService: OAuthService) {
    if (oauthService.hasValidIdToken()) {
      this.rootPage = 'HomePage';
    } else {
      this.rootPage = 'LoginPage';
    }
  }
}
```

In `src/pages/login/login.ts`, add your OIDC application settings in the constructor and add a `login()` method.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { IonicPage, App } from 'ionic-angular';
import { JwksValidationHandler, OAuthService } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';

@IonicPage({
  name: 'LoginPage'
})
@Component({
  selector: 'page-login',
  templateUrl: 'login.html'
})
export class LoginPage {

  constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService, private app: App) {
    if (this.oauthService.hasValidIdToken()) {
      this.app.getRootNavs()[0].setRoot('HomePage');
    }

    oauthService.redirectUri = window.location.origin;
    oauthService.clientId = '{clientId}';
    oauthService.scope = 'openid profile email';
    oauthService.issuer = 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default';
    oauthService.tokenValidationHandler = new JwksValidationHandler();
    oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin();
  }

  login() {
    this.oauthService.initImplicitFlow();
  }
}
```

Populate `src/pages/login/login.html` with the following HTML that welcomes the user and provides a login button.

```html
<ion-header>
  <ion-navbar>
    <ion-title>
      Login
    </ion-title>
  </ion-navbar>
</ion-header>
<ion-content padding>
  <div class="message">
    <p><strong>cryptoPWA</strong> is a <strong>P</strong>rogressive <strong>W</strong>eb <strong>A</strong>pplication
      that allows you to keep track of the approximate worth of your cryptocurrency portfolio.</p>

    <p>A PWA is like a typical application from the app store, but you can access it directly through the web. You may
      also add this page to your home screen to launch it like your other applications.</p>

    <p>Log in to start tracking your coins in whatever currency you wish!</p>
  </div>

  <button ion-button (click)="login()" color="primary">
    Login with Okta
  </button>
</ion-content>
```

In `src/pages/home/home.html`, add padding to the `ion-content` tag, change the `<div class="message">` to welcome the user by name, and modify the welcome message. This change is necessary because the original message says no account is required.

{% raw %}
```html
<ion-content padding>
  <h1>Welcome, {{ name }}</h1>
  <div class="message" *ngIf="!holdingsProvider.holdings.length">
    <p><strong>cryptoPWA</strong> is a <strong>P</strong>rogressive <strong>W</strong>eb <strong>A</strong>pplication
      that allows you to keep track of the approximate worth of your cryptocurrency portfolio.</p>

    <p>Click the button below to start tracking your coins in whatever currency you wish!</p>

    <button ion-button full (click)="addHolding()" color="primary">Add Coins</button>
  </div>
...
</ion-content>
```
{% endraw %}

Change `src/pages/home/home.ts` to check for a valid access token, and to have a getter for the ``name`` referenced in the template above.

```typescript
import { OAuthService } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';

...
export class HomePage {

   constructor(private navCtrl: NavController, private holdingsProvider: HoldingsProvider,
               private oauthService: OAuthService) {
   }

  ionViewDidLoad(): void {
    if (!this.oauthService.hasValidAccessToken()) {
      this.navCtrl.push('LoginPage');
    }
    this.holdingsProvider.loadHoldings();
  }

  ...

  get name() {
    const claims: any = this.oauthService.getIdentityClaims();
    if (!claims) {
      return null;
    }
    return claims.name;
  }
}
```

Restart `ionic serve`, and you should see the login page at `http://localhost:8100`.

{% img blog/cryptocurrency-pwa/login-page.png alt:"Login Page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click **Login with Okta** and you'll be redirected to a login form.

{% img blog/cryptocurrency-pwa/okta-login.png alt:"Okta Login" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

**TIP:** Did you know you don't need to include `@<your-email>.com` for the username with Okta? Entering the first part of your email address is enough for Okta to know who you are.

After entering valid credentials, you should be redirected back to your app and see a welcome message.

{% img blog/cryptocurrency-pwa/home-page.png alt:"Home Page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

You should be able to add cryptocurrency holdings as you did before. The last thing you'll want to do is add a logout button.

### Add a Logout Button

To add a logout button, add a `logout()` method to `src/pages/home/home.ts`.

```typescript
logout() {
  this.oauthService.logOut();
}
```

Then add a logout button just above `</ion-content>` in `src/pages/home/home.html`.

```html
<button ion-button (click)="logout()">Logout</button>
```

Your home page should now look as follows.

{% img blog/cryptocurrency-pwa/home-with-logout.png alt:"Home page with logout button" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

### Deploy to Firebase and Test with Lighthouse

If you'd like to deploy your app to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), log in to your account, go to the console, and create a new project. On the project overview screen, scroll to **Hosting** card, and click **Get Started**. Once you've completed the steps, you should be able to run the following commands to deploy your app.

```bash
npm run ionic:build --prod
firebase deploy
```

**NOTE:** You will need to install the `firebase-tools` package globally with `npm install -g firebase-tools` for the `firebase deploy` command to work.

I deployed mine to `https://cryptopwa-oidc.firebaseapp.com` and received a [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) score of 91. Lighthouse is an automated tool for auditing the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page to see audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more.

{% img blog/cryptocurrency-pwa/lighthouse-score-okta1.png alt:"Lighthouse Score: 91" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

I compared this with the original tutorial's production instance at <https://cryptopwa.com> and found it received the same score.

{% img blog/cryptocurrency-pwa/lighthouse-score-original.png alt:"Original Lighthouse Score: 91" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

I scrolled down my report to see why I didn't receive a perfect 💯. I had two failed audits:

* Does not provide fallback content when JavaScript is not available
* Has a `<meta name="viewport">` tag with `width` or `initial-scale` (Invalid properties found: `"{viewport-fit":"cover"}`)

To fix the first issue, add the following HTML in `src/index.html`, just after the `<body>` tag.

```html
<noscript>
  <h1>You must enable JavaScript to view this page.</h1>
</noscript>
```

To fix the second issue, remove `viewport-fit=cover,` from the `<meta name="viewport">` tag's `content` attribute.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no">
```

Redeploy using the commands below:

```bash
npm run ionic:build --prod
firebase deploy
```

Rerunning Lighthouse should give you a perfect PWA score of 100. *Huzzah!*

## Learn More About Ionic and PWAs

In a [future tutorial](/blog/2018/01/23/replace-local-storage-with-okta-profile-attributes), I'll show you how to replace this app's local storage implementation with Okta's custom profile attributes. This enhancement will allow you to track your cryptocurrency holdings from any device, with any browser!

For now, I hope you've enjoyed this brief look at Ionic, PWAs, and Okta. PWAs are more straightforward to distribute than mobile apps, and cloud services like Okta and Firebase make things even simpler.

You can see the complete source code for this project [on GitHub](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-ionic-crypto-pwa-example). Please contact me on Twitter [@mraible](https://twitter.com/mraible), via [Okta's Developer Forums](https://devforum.okta.com/), or in the comments below if you have any questions.
