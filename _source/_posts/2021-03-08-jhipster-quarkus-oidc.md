Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native, Java framework for building high-performance web, serverless, and native apps. It uses Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation and aggressive optimizations like classpath scanning, configuration reloading, and application bootstrap pre-configuration during the build process. This results in impressive startup performance. In other words, a Quarkus app starts up super fast!

Like Spring and Micronaut, Quarkus can take advantage of GraalVM to transform a JVM-based application into a native executable, improving the overall performance even more! 

Such performance gains allow the Java platform to be competitive in serverless, cloud, and Kubernetes environments by building Supersonic Subatomic Java applications.

Quarkus uses Java standards (like [MicroProfile](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile), [JAX-RS](https://github.com/jax-rs)) and best of breed libraries (such as [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) and [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/)). It even has support for [Spring](https://spring.io/)'s annotations.

## Quarkus + JHipster = Fast Java Made Easy

Development history has demonstrated gluing components together can be challenging. Developers love when you provide them enlightened opinions, and this is where JHipster comes in.

[JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) is a community-driven, full-stack development platform for generating, developing, and deploying modern web applications and microservice architectures. 

The default backend framework in JHipster is Spring Boot, but more and more options are appearing. One of these options is the [JHipster Quarkus blueprint](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-quarkus).

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/jhipster-quarkus.png alt:"JHipster Quarkus Blueprint" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Among others, one of the key capabilities that's determined JHipster's success is its extensibility via blueprints. A blueprint acts as a JHipster plugin and lets you override the default behavior to produce a new "flavor."

[JHipster's Kotlin blueprint](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin) is, for instance, a popular add-on that developers like to use.

Thanks to blueprints, the possibilities are infinite. This is why JHipster even has non-Java implementations (like [Node + NestJS](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-nodejs) and [.NET Core](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-dotnetcore).

This post will walk you through the steps to use JHipster, the Quarkus blueprint, and OAuth to build a native and secure full stack application.

## Create a Java Application with Quarkus

You'll need to install a few things before you get started.

**Prerequisites**:

- [Java 11+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- [Node.js 12+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Okta CLI 0.8.0+](https://cli.okta.com)

Install JHipster and its Quarkus blueprint using `npm`:

```shell
# Install JHipster globally
npm install -g generator-jhipster@6.10.5

# Install the JHipster Quarkus blueprint
npm install -g generator-jhipster-quarkus@1.1.1
```

The `jhipster-quarkus` command is now available as a shortcut for `jhipster --blueprints quarkus`. You can see all its options with the `--help` command.

```shell
$ jhipster-quarkus --help
```

## Generate a JHipster Quarkus Application

To begin, generate a JHipster app with a Quarkus backend. Open a terminal and create a directory for your application.

```shell
mkdir okta-jhipster-quarkus-example && cd okta-jhipster-quarkus-example
# oh-my-zsh users: take okta-jhipster-quarkus-example
```

You can invoke the `jhipster-quarkus` command to start the application creation wizard.

```shell
jhipster-quarkus
```

For this tutorial, the key question will be the one regarding authentication.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/generate-app.png alt:"Generate JHipster Quarkus app" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

JHipster Quarkus allows you to use JWT (with user management in the application database) or **OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Authentication** via identity providers like Keycloak and Okta. OIDC stands for OpenID Connect and is a thin layer on top of OAuth 2.0. Its primary purpose is to provide authentication and identify the user.

Below is an example of wizard answers.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/jhipster-quarkus-answers.png alt:"JHipster Quarkus Answers" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

After you answer all the questions, JHipster will generate your application code and run `npm install`.

If you'd like to generate the same as I did for this tutorial, you can copy the following JSON into a `.yo-rc.json` in your `okta-jhipster-quarkus-example` directory, and run `jhipster-quarkus`. 

```json
{
  "generator-jhipster": {
    "promptValues": {
      "packageName": "com.mycompany.myapp",
      "nativeLanguage": "en"
    },
    "jhipsterVersion": "6.10.5",

      }
    ],
    "enableTranslation": true,
    "nativeLanguage": "en",
    "languages": ["en"],
    "blueprints": [

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This file contains all the answers to JHipster's initial questions, and will allow you to generate your app without any prompts.

## Make Sure OAuth 2.0 / OIDC with Keycloak Works

Among other files, JHipster Quarkus generates a set of Docker Compose files to help you bootstrap a dev environment tailored for your freshly generated application. It even imports Keycloak default data with users and apps, so you don't have to. 

Keycloak is the default OIDC engine used by JHipster, and you can run it in a Docker container.

Start a Keycloak container using the command below:

```shell
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
```

With Keycloak up and running, you should be able to log in. Start your app using Maven:

```shell
./mvnw
```

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/jhipster-quarkus-keycloak.png alt:"JHipster Quarkus with Keycloak" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

You can see the app starts in `3.351s` and contains a vast list of Quarkus extensions (including `oidc`).

Go to `http://localhost:8080` in your favorite browser and click the **sign in** link.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/jhipster-quarkus-not-authenticated.png alt:"JHipster Quarkus not authenticated" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

You will be redirected to Keycloak to log in. Enter `admin/admin` when prompted for credentials.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/keycloak-login.png alt:"Keycloak login" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

After successfully authenticating, you'll be redirected back to your Quarkus app.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/jhipster-quarkus-authenticated.png alt:"JHipster Quarkus authenticated" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## How JHipster Quarkus OAuth 2.0 Support Works

One of the challenges when developing a JHipster blueprint like the Quarkus is finding the sweet spot between reusing existing mechanisms and custom implementation.

Since Day 1, JHipster has integrated modern web application frameworks (Angular, React, or even Vue.js) with de-facto standard Java-based technologies, like Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

The JHipster Quarkus OAuth 2.0 implementation relies on a `login/oauth2/code/oidc` redirect URI, which Spring Security expects. Doing server-side authentication is highly recommended since it's a lot more secure (because the browser does not have to manage any credentials or store any access tokens).

In JHipster Quarkus, to reuse the front applications as-is and implement a server-side OAuth 2.0 flow, the backend had to expose these two HTTP routes. This is why JHipster Quarkus has a `UserOauth2Controller` controller and customized Quarkus OIDC properties to make everything work properly.

This is the kind of integration pitfall developers don't want to waste time on. The collective intelligence of the JHipster community converges highly-efficient opinions, which explains the platform's popularity and quality.

## Integrate JHipster Quarkus with Okta

In this section, you'll learn how to use Okta as an OAuth 2.0 / OIDC provider. Okta has two options for configuring an OpenID Connect (OIDC) application. You can either go through the [developer console](https://developer.okta.com/) or use the [Okta CLI](https://github.com/okta/okta-cli).

### Use the Okta CLI to Configure JHipster

The Okta CLI automates all the JHipster + Okta configuration for you. You can install the Okta CLI using popular package managers.

**macOS (via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)):**

```bash
brew install --cask oktadeveloper/tap/okta
```

**Linux (via Flatpak):**

```bash
# Add Flathub repo
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

# install the package
flatpak install com.okta.developer.CLI

# add this to your appropriate dot file
alias okta="flatpak run com.okta.developer.CLI"
```

**Windows (via Chocolatey):**

```bash
choco install okta -version 0.8.0
```

You can also just pipe it to bash:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okta/okta-cli/master/cli/src/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Open a terminal, navigate to your Quarkus app's directory, and run `okta register` if you don't have an Okta developer account. If you already have one, run `okta login`.

```shell
$ okta register
First name: Daniel
Last name: Petisme
Email address: daniel.petisme@gmail.com
Company: Okta
Creating new Okta Organization, this may take a minute:
OrgUrl: https://dev-9323263.okta.com
An email has been sent to you with a verification code.

Check your email

To set your password open this link:
https://dev-9323263.okta.com/welcome/drpt2SjbRAPR-gvVHhnm
```

If you already have an Okta developer account, run `okta login`. Then, run `okta apps create jhipster` in your Quarkus app's directory. Accept the defaults when prompted for redirect URIs.

```shell
$ okta apps create jhipster
Application name [okta-jhipster-quarkus-example]:
Redirect URI
Common defaults:
  Spring Security - http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta
  Quarkus OIDC - http://localhost:8080/callback
  JHipster - http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc
Enter your Redirect URI(s) [http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc, http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc]:
Enter your Post Logout Redirect URI(s) [http://localhost:8080/, http://localhost:8761/]:

Okta application configuration has been written to: /Users/daniel/workspace/okta-jhipster-quarkus-example/.okta.env
```

**NOTE:** The `http://localhost:8761*` redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default. They aren't necessary for this tutorial, but there's no harm in leaving them in.

The Okta CLI will create an `.okta.env` in the current directory.  If you look at it, you'll see that it contains several OIDC-related keys and values. 

```shell
$ cat .okta.env
export QUARKUS_OIDC_AUTH_SERVER_URL="https://dev-9323263.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export QUARKUS_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="0oa5ozjxyNQPPbKc65d6"
export QUARKUS_OIDC_CREDENTIALS_SECRET="KEJ0oNOTFEUEFHP7i1TELLING1xLm1XPRn"
export QUARKUS_OIDC_AUTHENTICATION_REDIRECT_PATH="/login/oauth2/code/oidc"
export JHIPSTER_OIDC_LOGOUT_URL="https://dev-9323263.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/logout"
```

Source the file to set environment variables and start your application with Maven.

```shell
source .okta.env
./mvnw
```

_Make sure to add `*.env` to your `.gitignore` so you don't commit your client secret!_

Once it's started, open an incognito window to `http://localhost:8080` and sign in. You'll be prompted for your Okta credentials. 

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/okta-login.png alt:"Okta Login" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

After authenticating successfully, you'll be redirected back to your app. You should see your email address displayed on the homepage.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/okta-after-login.png alt:"Homepage after Okta login" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

The Okta CLI streamlines JHipster's configuration and does several things for you:

1. It creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs
2. It makes `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER` groups that JHipster expects
3. It adds your current user to the `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER` groups
4. It creates a `groups` claim in your default authorization server and adds the user's groups to it

What if you dislike the command line? Don't panic; I have your back! The Okta CLI is easy to use, but you might want to use a UI to configure things. That's why I'll go through each step to configure an OIDC application that works with JHipster Quarkus.

### Use Okta's Developer Console to Configure JHipster

If you don't have an Okta developer account, you need to [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/signup). It's nothing fancy: first name, last name, email, a strong password, and you're ready to go.

Once logged in, you arrive in your developer console:

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/dev-console.png alt:"Okta developer console homepage" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Expand **Applications** on the left nav, then go to **Applications** > **Add Application** > **Create New App** to start the app creation wizard.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/create-new-app.png alt:"Create New App" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Select **Web** and **OpenID Connect**. Then click **Create**.

You now need to provide some application settings.

* **Name**: Whatever you want, but "JHipster Quarkus" sounds cool 😎
* **Login redirect URIs**: Where Okta will redirect the user's browser once authenticated.
Set it to `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc`, as this is what's configured by default
* **Logout redirect URIs**: `http://localhost:8080` This is where the user will land after they log out
* **Group assignments**: Which groups can use this application

Use the default values for the rest of the settings.

When you're happy with your application, click **Done**. The next screen will show your application details.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/create-application-settings.png alt:"Configure Okta application settings" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

The most important values are:

* The client credentials (client id and client secret). They allow your Java application to authenticate against Okta services for user authentication and authorization flows.
* The Okta domain from which Quarkus will derive the OAuth / OIDC endpoint URLs.

#### Create User Groups

Now it's time to create user groups. Out of the box, JHipster requires two groups:

* `ROLE_USER`: for the authenticated users
* `ROLE_ADMIN`: for the authenticated users with administrator privileges on the application

In your developer console, go to **Directory** > **Groups**. Click on **Add Group** and create the `ROLE_ADMIN` group.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/create-group-admin.png alt:"Okta create ROLE_ADMIN group" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Next, add the `ROLE_USER` group.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/create-group-user.png alt:"Okta create ROLE_USER group" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

You're done with the user groups; now, let's add users.

#### Create Users

To see the difference between an admin user and a regular user, create users in each group. Using the Okta developer console, go to **Directory** > **People**. 

Click on **Add Person**. Start by creating an `Administrator` user.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/add-admin-user.png alt:"Okta create Admin user" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

The key points are to associate the `Administrator` user to the `ROLE_ADMIN` group.
For this tutorial's sake, use the `Set by Admin` password strategy to define an initial password the user will have to change.

I recommend using the **Set by User** strategy with an activation email in a real-life context.

Now, add a regular user.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/add-regular-user.png alt:"Okta create regular user" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Make sure the `User` person is a member of the `ROLE_USER` group. It's important to use a valid email address for password recovery purposes.

Go to **Applications** > **JHipster Quarkus** and click on **Assignments**. Assign the users you just created.

#### Add a Groups Claim to the ID Token

The last thing you'll need to do is configure a groups claim that includes a user's groups in the ID token. Go to **Security** > **API** and click on **default**. Go to **Claims** > **Add Claim**. Enter the following values:

* Name: `groups`
* Include in token type: **ID Token**
* Value type: **groups**
* Filter: **Matches regex** with a value of `.*`

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/add-claim.png alt:"Add Groups claim" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Click **Create**.

The Okta configuration for JHipster is now complete! 

#### Configure Quarkus OIDC for Okta

At this point, you have a JHipster Quarkus Application running and configured to use Keycloak as its identity provider.

Let's change it to use Okta.

First, you need to log out from the JHipster web application to prevent cookie collisions.
Go to **Account** > **Sign Out**.

**NOTE**: You can leave the application running. Quarkus provides what they call a **Dev Mode** which hot reloads any source or resource file whenever they are updated. It's super slick!

Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties` and find the following OIDC configuration section.

```properties
# OAuth 2.0 and OIDC
quarkus.oidc.enabled=true
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/
%dev.quarkus.oidc.client-id=web_app
%dev.quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=web_app
quarkus.oidc.application-type=hybrid
quarkus.oidc.authentication.scopes=profile,address,email,address,phone,offline_access
quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path=/
quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path=/login/oauth2/code/oidc
quarkus.oidc.authentication.restore-path-after-redirect=false

jhipster.oidc.logout-url=http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/protocol/openid-connect/logout

%test.quarkus.oidc.client-id=dummy
%test.quarkus.oidc.application-type=service
%test.jhipster.oidc.logout-url=some-dummy-logoutUrl
```

The above values are for Keycloak. You need to update the following properties to integrate your application with Okta.

* `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url`: The Okta's API root URL derived from the OIDC application domain.
* `quarkus.oidc.client-id`: The OIDC application's client ID.
* `quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret`: The OIDC application's client secret.
* `jhipster.oidc.logout-url`: In JHipster, the browser will initiate the logout. The backend needs to expose this information (for now, it can't be retrieved using OIDC discovery).

After you update this file, your properties should look similar to the following:

```properties
# OAuth 2.0 and OIDC
quarkus.oidc.enabled=true
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=https://dev-9323263.okta.com/oauth2/default
quarkus.oidc.client-id=0oaajhdr9q9jxbBM95d6
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=NEVERSHOWSECRETS
quarkus.oidc.application-type=hybrid
quarkus.oidc.authentication.scopes=profile,address,email,address,phone
quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path=/
quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path=/login/oauth2/code/oidc
quarkus.oidc.authentication.restore-path-after-redirect=false

jhipster.oidc.logout-url=https://dev-9323263.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/logout
```

Restart your application go to `http://localhost:8080`. Click on **sign in**, and you'll be redirected to an Okta login page.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/okta-login.png alt:"Okta login" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Enter the `admin` username and the password you set. Okta detects it's the first time you've logged in and asks you to update the password. Once done, you'll be redirected to your Quarkus application.

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/okta-after-login-admin.png alt:"Admin user authenticated with Okta" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## Go Native with Quarkus and GraalVM

The final step of this tutorial is to package your Java application as a native executable. Once again, JHipster has your back, and everything is done for you.

Simply run Maven's `package` command with the `native` profile:

```shell
./mvnw package -Pnative -DskipTests
```

You know, we know, everybody knows, we skipped the tests so this demo works flawlessly. Please **do NOT skip the tests** in a production context. 😅

If you're not using a JDK with GraalVM included, you'll get an error:

```shell
[error]: Build step io.quarkus.deployment.pkg.steps.NativeImageBuildStep#build threw an
 exception: java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot find the `native-image` in the 
 GRAALVM_HOME, JAVA_HOME and System PATH. Install it using `gu install native-image`
```

The easiest way to solve this is to use [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) to install Java 11 with GraalVM.

```shell
sdk install java 21.0.0.2.r11-grl
```

Then, run `gu install native-image`:

```shell
$ gu install native-image
Downloading: Component catalog from www.graalvm.org
Processing Component: Native Image
Downloading: Component native-image: Native Image  from github.com
Installing new component: Native Image (org.graalvm.native-image, version 21.0.0.2)
```

Once this process completes, rerun the Maven package command.

```shell
./mvnw package -Pnative -DskipTests
```

The native compilation takes a long time. You might want to go for a walk, get a cup of coffee, or do some pushups.

If you'd rather stay at your computer, here are some other activities you might try:

* Check out the [JHipster Quarkus Blueprint project](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-quarkus)
* Explore the [Okta developer site](https://developer.okta.com/
) 
* Go through [the excellent Quarkus guides](https://quarkus.io/guides/) 

After roughly three minutes, the native executable should be ready:

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/quarkus-native-compile.png alt:"JHipster Quarkus Native compilation" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Start it as a native executable using `target/*runner`:

{% img blog/jhipster-quarkus-oidc/quarkus-native-run.png alt:"JHipster Quarkus Native Run" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

💥 Boom! Your good old-fashioned Java application starts in **1 second**! 🚀

Remember, I talked about memory gains? Below is a command to get the memory consumption in megabytes.

```shell
$ ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color jhipster | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'
30951 46M ./target/jhipster-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
31433 0M grep --color=auto --exclude-dir=.bzr --exclude-dir=CVS --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.hg --exclude-dir=.svn --color jhipster
```

Your application is consuming < 50MB of memory. 💃🏻

Go to `http://localhost:8080` and make sure everything works. Then, enjoy your success! 

## Go Further with JHipster Quarkus

I hope you enjoyed this tutorial on creating a native app with Java, Quarkus, and JHipster. Isn't it cool how JHipster and the Okta CLI do most of the heavy lifting for you?!
