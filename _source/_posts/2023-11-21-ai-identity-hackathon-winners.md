In late September, in partnership with [DevPost](https://devpost.com/), we announced the [AI and Identity - Okta Hackathon 2023](https://oktahackathon2023.devpost.com/), and invited developers across the globe to "_build an app that integrates identity standards with a flair of AI._"

We were excited to see how participants would respond to the challenge, and we were not disappointed! Consider these key numbers:

**Total Hackathon Registrants**: 576<br/>
**Total App Submissions**: 22<br/>
**Total Eligible Submissions**: 9<br/>

At the close of the competition on November 6th, we surveyed all participants and tallied up the results. A panel of judges evaluated the qualifying submissions, discussed, deliberated, and selected winners. _It wasn't easy._

A huge round of applause to the hundreds who registered and participated, a shout-out of gratitude to everyone who offered support and guidance in the forums, those who reached out to us during office hours, and special props to those nine teams and individuals who made it to the finish line with eligible submissions!

All were in competition for the following awards:
