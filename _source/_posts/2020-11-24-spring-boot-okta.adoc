The Okta CLI is a new tool we've created here at Okta. It's designed to streamline the process of creating new Okta accounts, registering apps, and getting started. Wwwhhaaattt, you might say?! That's right, it's super awesome!

To show you how much fun it is, I https://youtu.be/nizsd2yYch0[created a screencast that shows you how to use it].

For those that would rather read than watch, please read on.

== Install the Okta CLI

You can find the website for the Okta CLI at https://cli.okta.com/[cli.okta.com]. This site has instructions on how to use common package managers on macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also use cURL:

[source,shell]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-cli/master/cli/src/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
----

Once you have the Okta CLI installed, you'll need https://adoptopenjdk.net/[Java 11 installed] to run your Spring Boot app.

== Create a Spring Boot App

To create a secure Spring Boot app with Okta, run `okta start`. You'll need to verify your email and set a password as part of this.

Then, you'll be prompted to select from a list of samples:

[source,shell]
----
Select a sample
> 1: Spring Boot + Okta
> 2: Vue + Okta
> 3: ASP.net Core 3  MVC
> 4: Angular + Okta
----

Type `1` and **Enter** to select Spring Boot.

TIP: If you already have an Okta account, you can run `okta login` first.

This will download our https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-spring-boot-sample[Okta Spring Boot sample], register your app on Okta, and configure it by creating a `.okta.env` file with your issuer and client ID.

Follow the instructions that are printed out for you. To summarize:

[source,shell]
----
cd spring-boot
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

Next, open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`. You will see a screen like the following.

Click **Login** and authenticate with your credentials.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/okta-cli-angular/login.png' %}[alt=Angular Login,width=800,align=center]

Upon successful sign-in, you'll be returned to your app. Click on **Profile** to see your data that's retrieved using our Angular SDK's `getUser()` method.

[source,typescript]
----
export class ProfileComponent implements OnInit {
  claims: Array<Claim>;

  constructor(public oktaAuth: OktaAuthService) {}

  async ngOnInit() {
    const userClaims = await this.oktaAuth.getUser();
    this.claims = Object.entries(userClaims).map(entry => ({ claim: entry[0], value: entry[1] }));
  }

}
