The Okta CLI is a new tool we've created here at Okta. It's designed to streamline the process of creating new Okta accounts, registering apps, and getting started. Wwwhhaaattt, you might say?! That's right, it's super awesome!

To show you how much fun it is, I https://youtu.be/dURkaz0kBSU[created a screencast that shows you how to use it].

For those that would rather read than watch, please read on.

== Install the Okta CLI

You can find the website for the Okta CLI at https://cli.okta.com/[cli.okta.com]. This site has instructions on how to use common package managers on macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can also use cURL:

[source,shell]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okta/okta-cli/master/cli/src/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
----

Once you have the Okta CLI installed, you'll need https://adoptopenjdk.net/[Java 11 installed] to run your Spring Boot app.

== Create a Spring Boot App

To create a secure Spring Boot app with Okta, run `okta start spring-boot`. You'll need to verify your email and set a password as part of this.

TIP: If you already have an Okta account, you can run `okta login` first.

This will download our https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-spring-boot-sample[Okta Spring Boot sample], register your app on Okta, and configure it by adding your Okta settings to `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

Follow the instructions that are printed out for you. To summarize:

[source,shell]
----
cd spring-boot
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

Next, open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`. You'll likely be logged in straight away and see your name printed on the screen.

If you use another browser, or an incognito window, you'll be prompted to sign in first.

If you open `src/main/java/com/example/sample/Application.java`, you'll see the Java code that's used to render your name. You might appreciate how Spring Security makes authentication with OpenID Connect easy.

[source,java]
----
@RestController
static class SimpleRestController {
    @GetMapping("/")
    String sayHello(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser oidcUser) {
        return "Hello: " + oidcUser.getFullName();
    }
}
