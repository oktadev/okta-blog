Developers love to automate things. It's what we do for a living for the most part. We create programs that take the tediousness out of tasks. I do a lot of presentations and live demos. Over the past year, I've noticed that some of my demos have too many steps to remember. I've written them down in scripts, but I've recently learned it's much cooler to automate them with tools powered by Schematics!

Schematics is a library from the Angular CLI project that allows you to manipulate projects with code. You can create/update files and add dependencies to any project that has a `package.json` file. That's right, Schematics aren't just for Angular projects! 

Do you have a minute? I'd love to show you how can use a Schematic I wrote to add authentication to a React app. You'll need Node.js 10+ installed; then run:

```bash
npx create-react-app rs --typescript
```

{% img "blog/react-schematics/create-react-app.png" alt:"Create React app with TypeScript" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

While that process completes, create an OIDC app on Okta.

Why Okta? Because friends don't let friends write authentication! Okta has Authentication and User Management APIs that greatly reduce your development time. Our API and SDKs make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users in any application. Not only that, theirs a free level for developers that gets you up to 1000 active user per month.

### Create an OIDC App on Okta

Log in to your Okta Developer account (or [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) if you don't have an account) and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Single-Page App** and click **Next**. Give the app a name you'll remember, change the port from `8080` to `3000`, and click **Done**.

The next screen should look similar to the following:

{% img "blog/react-schematics/app-settings.png" alt:"Okta OIDC App Settings" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

Go back to the terminal window where you created the `rs` app. Navigate into the directory and run the app to make sure it starts on port 3000. 

```shell
cd rs
npm start
```

Stop the process (Ctrl+C) and add OIDC authentication to your app with the following commands:

```shell
npm i @oktadev/schematics
schematics @oktadev/schematics:add-auth
```

When prompted, enter your issuer (it can be found in Okta's dashboard under **API** > **Authorization Servers**) and client ID. When the installation completes, run `npm start` and marvel at your React app with OIDC authentication!

{% img "blog/react-schematics/react-okta.png" alt:"React + Okta = 💙" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click **login**, enter the credentials you used to signup with Okta, and you'll be redirected back to your app. This time, a **logout** button will be displayed. 

## Create a React Schematic

It's neat to see a Schematic in action, and it's fun to write them too! Now I'll show you how to use Schematics to modify a project created with Create React App. 

Why React? Because it's popular and fun to write apps with (in my experience). Also, Eric Elliot predicts "React Continues to Dominate in 2019" in his [Top JavaScript Frameworks and Topics to Learn in 2019](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-and-topics-to-learn-in-2019-b4142f38df20).

Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework, and React has support for it via [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/). In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a schematic that integrates reactstrap. It's a straightforward example, and I'll include unit and integrating testing tips.

## Schematics: Manipulate Files and Dependencies with Code

Angular DevKit is part of the [Angular CLI project on GitHub](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). DevKit provides libraries that can be used to manage, develop, deploy, and analyze your code. DevKit has a `schematics-cli` command line tool that you can use to create your own Schematics.

To create a Schematics project, first install the Schematics CLI:

```shell
npm i -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli@0.13.4
```

Then run `schematics` to create a new empty project. Name it `rsi` as an abbreviation for ReactStrap Installer.

```shell
schematics blank --name=rsi
```

This will create a `rsi` directory and install the project's dependencies. There's a `rsi/package.json` that handles your project's dependencies. There's also a `src/collection.json` that defines the metadata for your schematics.

```json
{
  "$schema": "../node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/collection-schema.json",
  "schematics": {
    "rsi": {
      "description": "A blank schematic.",
      "factory": "./rsi/index#rsi"
    }
  }
}
```

You can see that the `rsi` schematic points to a function in `src/rsi/index.ts`. Open that file and you'll see the following:

```typescript
import { Rule, SchematicContext, Tree } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';

export function rsi(_options: any): Rule {
  return (tree: Tree, _context: SchematicContext) => {
    return tree;
  };
}
```

It's tested by `src/rsi/index_spec.ts`.

```typescript
import { Tree } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';
import { SchematicTestRunner } from '@angular-devkit/schematics/testing';
import * as path from 'path';

const collectionPath = path.join(__dirname, '../collection.json');

describe('rsi', () => {
  it('works', () => {
    const runner = new SchematicTestRunner('schematics', collectionPath);
    const tree = runner.runSchematic('rsi', {}, Tree.empty());

    expect(tree.files).toEqual([]);
  });
});
```

One neat thing about Schematics is they don't perform any direct actions on your filesystem. Instead, you specify actions against a `Tree`. The `Tree` is a data structure with a set of files that already exist and a staging area (of files that contain new/updated code). 

## Schematics with React

If you're familiar with Schematics, you've probably seen them used to manipulate Angular projects. Schematics has excellent support for Angular, but they can run on any project if you code it right! Instead of looking for Angular-specifics, you can just look for `package.json` and a common file structure. CLI tools, like Create React App, that generate projects make this a lot easier to do because you know where files will be created.

## Add Dependencies to Your React App with Schematics

The [reactstrap docs](https://reactstrap.github.io/) provide installation instructions. 
These are the steps you will automate with the `rsi` schematic.

1. `npm i bootstrap reactstrap`
2. Import Bootstrap's CSS
3. Import and use reactstrap components

You can use [Schematics Utilities](https://nitayneeman.github.io/schematics-utilities/) to automate adding dependencies, among other things. Start by opening a terminal window and installing `schematic-utilities` in the `rsi` project you created.

```shell
npm i schematics-utilities@1.1.1
```

Change `src/rsi/index.ts` to add `bootstrap` and `reactstrap` as dependencies with an `addDependencies()` function. Call this method from the main `rsi()` function.

```typescript
import { Rule, SchematicContext, Tree } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';
import { addPackageJsonDependency, NodeDependency, NodeDependencyType } from 'schematics-utilities';

function addDependencies(host: Tree): Tree {
  const dependencies: NodeDependency[] = [
    { type: NodeDependencyType.Default, version: '4.3.1', name: 'bootstrap' },
    { type: NodeDependencyType.Default, version: '7.1.0', name: 'reactstrap' }
  ];
  dependencies.forEach(dependency => addPackageJsonDependency(host, dependency));
  return host;
}

export function rsi(_options: any): Rule {
  return (tree: Tree, _context: SchematicContext) => {
    addDependencies(tree);
    return tree;
  };
}
```

## Create, Copy, and Update React Files

Create a `src/rsi/templates/src` directory. You'll create templates in this directory that already have the necessary reactstrap imports and usage.

Add an `App.js` template and put the following Bootstrap-ified code in it.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import { Alert } from 'reactstrap';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <p>
            Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
          </p>
          <Alert color="success">reactstrap installed successfully! 
            <span role="img" aria-label="hooray">🎉</span>
            </Alert>
        </header>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Create an `index.js` file in the same directory to add the Bootstrap CSS import.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

serviceWorker.unregister();
```

Modify the `rsi()` function in `src/rsi/index.ts` to copy these templates and overwrite existing files.

```typescript
import { Rule, SchematicContext, Tree, apply, url, template, move, forEach, FileEntry, mergeWith, MergeStrategy } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';
import { addPackageJsonDependency, NodeDependency, NodeDependencyType } from 'schematics-utilities';
import { normalize } from 'path';

function addDependencies(host: Tree): Tree {
  const dependencies: NodeDependency[] = [
    { type: NodeDependencyType.Default, version: '4.3.1', name: 'bootstrap' },
    { type: NodeDependencyType.Default, version: '7.1.0', name: 'reactstrap' }
  ];
  dependencies.forEach(dependency => addPackageJsonDependency(host, dependency));
  return host;
}

export function rsi(_options: any): Rule {
  return (tree: Tree, _context: SchematicContext) => {
    addDependencies(tree);

    const movePath = normalize('./src');
    const templateSource = apply(url('./templates/src'), [
      template({..._options}),
      move(movePath),
      // fix for https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/11337
      forEach((fileEntry: FileEntry) => {
        if (tree.exists(fileEntry.path)) {
          tree.overwrite(fileEntry.path, fileEntry.content);
        }
        return fileEntry;
      }),
    ]);
    const rule = mergeWith(templateSource, MergeStrategy.Overwrite);
    return rule(tree, _context);
  };
}
```

## Test Your reactstrap Installer Schematic

In order to add dependencies to `package.json`, you have to provide one in your tests. Luckily, TypeScript 2.9 added JSON imports, so you can create a testable version of `package.json` (as generated by Create React App) and add it to `Tree` before you run the test.

In the `rsi/tsconfig.json` file, under compiler options, add these two lines:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true  
  }
}
```

Create `react-pkg.json` in the same directory as `index_spec.ts`.  

```json
{
  "name": "rsi-test",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.8.3",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.3",
    "react-scripts": "2.1.5"
  }
}
```

Now you can import this file in your test and add it to a testable tree. This allows you to verify the files are created, as well as their contents. Modify `src/rsi/index_spec.ts` to match the code below.

```typescript
import { HostTree } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';
import { SchematicTestRunner, UnitTestTree } from '@angular-devkit/schematics/testing';
import * as path from 'path';
import packageJson from './react-pkg.json';

const collectionPath = path.join(__dirname, '../collection.json');

describe('rsi', () => {
  it('works', () => {
    const tree = new UnitTestTree(new HostTree);
    tree.create('/package.json', JSON.stringify(packageJson));

    const runner = new SchematicTestRunner('schematics', collectionPath);
    runner.runSchematic('rsi', {}, tree);

    expect(tree.files.length).toEqual(3);
    expect(tree.files.sort()).toEqual(['/package.json', '/src/App.js', '/src/index.js']);

    const mainContent = tree.readContent('/src/index.js');
    expect(mainContent).toContain(`import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'`);
  });
});
```

Run `npm test` and rejoice when everything passes!

## Verify Your React Schematic Works

You can verify your schematic works by creating a new React project with Create React App's defaults, installing your schematic, and running it.

```shell
npx create-react-app test
```

Run `npm link /path/to/rsi` to install your reactstrap installer. You might need to adjust the `rsi` project's path to fit your system. 

```shell
cd test
npm link ../rsi
```

Run `schematics rsi:rsi` and you should see files being updated.

```shell
UPDATE /package.json (530 bytes)
UPDATE /src/App.js (620 bytes)
UPDATE /src/index.js (294 bytes)
```

Run `npm install` followed by `npm start` and bask in the glory of your React app with Bootstrap installed!

## Schematics with Angular 

Angular CLI is based on Schematics, as are its PWA and Angular Material modules. I won't go into Angular-specific Schematics here, you can read [Use Angular Schematics to Simplify Your Life](/blog/2019/02/13/angular-schematics) for that.

This tutorial includes information on how to add prompts, how to publish your Schematic, and it references the [OktaDev Schematics](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/schematics) project that I helped develop. This project's continuous integration uses a [`test-app.sh`](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/schematics/blob/master/test-app.sh) script that creates projects with each framework's respective CLI. For example, here's the script that tests creating a new Create React App's project, and installing the schematic.

```bash
elif [ "$1" == "react" ] || [ "$1" == "r" ]
then
  npx create-react-app react-app
  cd react-app
  npm install ../../oktadev*.tgz
  schematics @oktadev/schematics:add-auth --issuer=$issuer --clientId=$clientId
  CI=true npm test
```

This project has support for TypeScript-enabled React projects as well.
