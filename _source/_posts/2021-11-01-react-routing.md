When building an SPA (single page application) with React, routing is one of the fundamental processes a developer must handle. React routing is the process of building routes, determining the content at the route, and securing it under authentication and authorization. There are many tools available to manage and secure your routes in React. The most commonly used one is `react-router`. However, many developers are not in a situation where they can use the `react-router` library. Because of this, they may need to use Reach Router, Wouter, or maybe even no router at all.

This tutorial will show you how to quickly build a secure SPA using React, Okta, and Wouter. Okta easily enables you to manage access to your SPAs (or any application for that matter). By using the `@okta/okta-react` library you can quickly build secure applications with React. At the time of writing this article, [reach-router does not support React version 17+](https://github.com/reach/router/issues/429).

**Prerequisites**:

- [Node 14](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)

## Create an Okta OIDC application

{% include setup/cli.md type="spa" framework="React" loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000/callback" logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000" %}

Once Okta is done processing your request it will return an *Issuer* and a *Client ID*. Make sure you note these, as you will need them in your application.

## Create a React application with routing

Next, open your favorite IDE (I use Visual Studio Code) and use the task runner `npx create-react-app react-routing-demo` to scaffold your React project. You'll be prompted to install `create-react-app`. Type **y** to approve.

This process takes a minute, so grab a cup of coffee or tea if you prefer. The task runner does a great job of getting your application started quickly, but you will need to add and edit a few of the files.

Before you begin, you will need to install some packages.

First, of course, wouter.

```shell
cd react-routing-demo
npm i wouter@2.7.5
```

You will use Bootstrap along with the react-bootstrap library to style your app.

```shell
npm i bootstrap@5.1.3
npm i react-bootstrap@1.6.4
```

Next, you will get dotenv as a way of storing your sensitive Okta information.

```shell
npm i dotenv@10.0.0
```

Finally, you will add the Okta React SDK to your project.

```shell
npm i @okta/okta-react@6.2.0 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.6.0
```

With these dependencies installed, you can begin to create your app. First, add a new file called `.env` to the root of your project, and add the following items. Note here that the `REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER` should match the issuer from the Okta CLI.

```dotenv
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
```

Next, add a folder for `Components` and one for `Pages`. 

```shell
mkdir src/Components
mkdir src/Pages
```

In `Components` add a new file for `Header.jsx` and add the following code.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Navbar, Nav, Form, Button } from "react-bootstrap";

const Header = ({ authState, oktaAuth }) => {
  if (authState?.isPending) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  const button = authState?.isAuthenticated ? (
    <Button
      variant="secondary"
      onClick={() => {
        oktaAuth.signOut("/");
      }}
    >
      Logout
    </Button>
  ) : (
    <Button
      variant="secondary"
      onClick={() => {
        oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
      }}
    >
      Login
    </Button>
  );

  return (
    <Navbar bg="light" expand="lg">
      <Navbar.Brand href="/">React Routing</Navbar.Brand>
      <Navbar.Toggle aria-controls="basic-navbar-nav" />
      <Navbar.Collapse id="basic-navbar-nav">
        <Nav className="mr-auto"></Nav>
        <Form inline>{button}</Form>
      </Navbar.Collapse>
    </Navbar>
  );
};
export default Header;
```

This component displays a login button for your users. This button turns into a logout button once the user authenticates. The component also provides a place to access the `Profile` page you will create.

Add `Profile.jsx` to the `Pages` folder. The code for this file is as follows.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { Container } from "react-bootstrap";

import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

import Header from "../Components/Header";

const Profile = () => {
  const { authState, oktaAuth } = useOktaAuth();

  useEffect(() => {
    async function authenticate() {
      if (!authState) return;

      if (!authState.isAuthenticated) {
        await oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
      }
    }

    authenticate();
  }, [authState, oktaAuth]);

  if (!authState?.isAuthenticated) {
    return (
      <Container>
        <p>Please wait while we sign you in</p>
      </Container>
    );
  } else {
    return (
      <Container>
        <Header authState={authState} oktaAuth={oktaAuth}></Header>
        <h4>Your profile page</h4>

        <p>Welcome to your profile page </p>
      </Container>
    );
  }
};

export default Profile;
```

This page leverages the `useOktaAuth` hook to determine if the user is logged in. If the user is not logged in, then you will prompt them to log in with Okta. Otherwise, you will display a brief profile page.

Finally, add `Home.jsx` to the `Pages` folder with the following code.

{% raw %}
```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Link, Redirect } from "wouter";

import Header from "../Components/Header";

import { Container, Row, Col, Card } from "react-bootstrap";
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

const Home = () => {
  const { authState, oktaAuth } = useOktaAuth();

  return authState?.isAuthenticated ? (
    <Redirect to="/Profile" />
  ) : (
    <Container>
      <Header authState={authState} oktaAuth={oktaAuth}></Header>

      <Row>
        <Col sm={12} className="text-center">
          <h3>React routing Demo</h3>

      </Row>

      <br></br>

      <Row>
        <Col sm={12} className="text-center">
          <Card style={{ width: "21.5em", margin: "0 auto" }}>
            <Card.Header>Already have an Okta Account?</Card.Header>
            <Card.Body>
              <Link to="Profile">Login Here</Link>
            </Card.Body>
          </Card>
        </Col>
      </Row>
    </Container>
  );
};

export default Home;
```
{% endraw %}

This page uses the `Redirect` component from wouter combined with the `useOktaAuth` hook to redirect authenticated users to the profile page. The page also serves as a landing page with some additional information about your application.

Finally, you will need to update your `App.js` file with the following code.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";

import { Router, Route } from "wouter";

import { Security, LoginCallback } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";

import Home from "./Pages/Home";
import Profile from "./Pages/Profile";

import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";

const issuer = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER;
const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + "/callback";

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
      issuer: issuer,
      clientId: clientId,
      redirectUri: redirect,
    });

    this.restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) => {
      window.location.replace(
        toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin)
      );
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <Security
          oktaAuth={this.oktaAuth}
          restoreOriginalUri={this.restoreOriginalUri}
        >
          <Route path="/" component={Home} />
          <Route path="/callback" component={LoginCallback} />
          <Route path="/Profile" component={Profile} />
        </Security>
      </Router>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Version 6.0 of the `@okta/okta-react` library includes a few changes to be aware of, depending on which version of the package you most recently used.

First, you must provide the `restoreOriginalUri` property in the `<Security>` component. If you were previously using version 4.x, you will notice that you need to inject the `OktaAuth` object into the `Security` component rather than the issuer, client ID, and other information. You can read more about these changes on [Okta's React GitHub page](https://github.com/okta/okta-react#migrating-between-versions).

Here you are also importing the `bootstrap` CSS.  

Finally, you are setting up the routing by wrapping the wouter `Router` in Okta's `Security` component. This will give your routes access to the Okta API.  

## Run your React application 

Your application is now complete. You can run it using `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. From there you click the **Login** button, which will display the Okta login screen. Once you've logged in successfully you are redirected to the `Profile` page.

## Learn more about React

With Okta React v6.0+, you no longer need access to the `react-router` package to set up routing in your React application. This version should make it easier and cleaner to set up Reach Router, Wouter, or to bypass using a router altogether.

You can find the example code from this tutorial in the [oktadev/okta-react-router-example](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-routing-example) project on GitHub.
