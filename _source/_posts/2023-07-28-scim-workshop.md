Hello SaaS developers! You sell your software to technologically mature enterprises, and they expect it to interface seamlessly with all their other tools. In our [Enterprise-Ready Workshop on OpenID Connect](/blog/2023-07-28-oidc_workshop), you learned how to solve part of this problem, by creating user accounts in your application for your customers' employees whenever they log in.

But creating accounts when users log in is only one of your customers' many expectations! Your app is also expected to know about users who haven't logged in yet, and remove the accounts of employees who are removed from your customer's identity provider. 

In this workshop, we'll solve those problems and more with SCIM, the System for Cross-domain Identity Management. SCIM is an open standard protocol that allows us to manage identities across systems as well as common user lifecycles. In this workshop, we will enhance a sample application by adding SCIM server functionality to it, and connect the sample application's SCIM server to an Okta client. 

For an in-depth walkthrough of developing and troubleshooting the code in this workshop, follow along on with the video:

In this workshop, we'll cover the following:

{% include toc.md %}

By following these steps, you will learn how to implement SCIM and support provisioning from multiple organizations/tenants. Although we'll integrate with Okta as an example, remember that almost every identity provider on the web has SCIM support! 

## Managing users across systems at scale

SaaS customers have high expectations for the applications that they purchase. Customers, especially at enterprise scale, expect apps to seamlessly integrate with identity providers in order to maximize user productivity.
- Enterprise customers expect that onboarding a user in their identity provider will immediately create accounts for that user in all of SaaS apps where they grant that user access.
- For security as well as convenience, customers expect that deleting or deactivating a user account from their identity provider will delete that user's accounts from all their enterprise SaaS apps. 
- Manually adding accounts at scale

SCIM, the System for Cross-domain Identity Management, is an open standard which addresses those problems. SCIM: 
- Provides near-instant updates to the SaaS app whenever someone joins, moves inside of, or leaves a company
- Allows management of user identities in cloud-based applications and services - i.e., you will have an awareness of your enterprise customers' users' up-to-date information
- Enables automated control of user lifecycle (governance): provisioning (joiner), synchronizing user changes (movers), and de-provisioning (leaver) between identity providers (IdPs) and service providers (SPs)
- Promotes interoperability via an open standard, which means allowing systems to exchange and make use of info being shared, e.g., I have worked with partners who have used SCIM as a solution to role-based access to resources 

### Why do we love SCIM for user management?

SCIM is a very well-designed standard; therefore, it can be implemented across systems that are compliant. It simplifies user identity management, thereby reducing manual admin tasks vs. having to manage user lifecycles across multiple applications. It allows user identity management by providing insight into up-to-date user information vs. having no governance over user information and assigned resources across services. Above all, it contributes to improved security! And now, who doesn't want that in this day and age?

Now that I've provided you with some background on SCIM, let's move on to building the server!

## Implement user management using SCIM in a SaaS application 

Before we build our SCIM server, let's have a plan of action. 

- Learn about functions that support SCIM: Create, Read, Update, Delete Functions and JSON formatted requests and responses
- Install the sample application and set up your development environment
- Build the SCIM Interface in the Todo sample app and test it with Postman

{% img blog/scim-workshop/scim-diagram.jpg alt:"Diagram of SCIM workflow showing the Identity Provider requests the SCIM server with GET, POST, PUT, and DEL user calls and the SCIM server responds with a standard SCIM interface" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

SCIM is implemented as a RESTful API. It uses `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete` endpoints. The endpoints required by the SCIM spec are: 

- GET /Users - Retrieve all users 
- GET /Users?filter=userName - GET User with the filter "userName" (filtering is optional)
- GET /User/id - Retrieve a specific User by id
- POST /User - Create a user
- PUT /User/id - Update user info by id
- DEL /User/id - Delete a user by id (*Note: Okta users soft delete via PATCH)

SCIM uses the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format for requesting and responding to and from the Identity Provider and SCIM server. 

Have you seen these endpoints before? Are they familiar to you? Perhaps you've built backend applications with these API endpoints. Let's build on that knowledge. 

Before we begin, please note that this implementation of SCIM is meant to be vendor agnostic, and I will be adding notes on how Okta implements this standard throughout the demo. More importantly, we'll refer to [the SCIM 2.0 spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644) to build the server. 

## Set Up the sample React and Express application

Follow [these setup instructions](/blog/2023/07/27/enterprise-ready-getting-started) to install and run the Todo sample app. Run `node -v` and make sure you have Node version 18 or newer. 

We will build SCIM support atop the OIDC support added in the Enterprise-Ready Workshop on OpenID Connect. To start with a version of  [the sample app](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-enterprise-ready-workshops/) that already has OIDC support implemented, `git checkout oidc-workshop-complete`. 

## Update the User model to support SCIM

The SCIM specification contains optional features and room for interpretation, so not all clients implement it identically. When supporting a new client from your SCIM server, consult that client's docs to see which optional features they expect you to support. 

 When integrating with Okta, we will need to track whether each user is active. To track this, we'll add an `active` field to the Prisma database schema, specifically the user table. Here we will add the field attribute `active` and set that to be a Boolean to inform us whether or not the user is active. Although not required by the SCIM protocol as a core attribute, we will need this later when connecting with Okta.

Speaking of attributes, the SCIM core user schema requires only three attributes (all other attributes are optional):

- `id`, service provider-defined identifier
- `userName`, a unique identifier for the user 
- `meta`, read-only metadata maintained by the service provider

These are described in section 8.1 of the [SCIM spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-8.1). 

Note: We'll be using a basic autoincrement for the user's id to lessen the complexity of this project. However, for production, we recommend using a unique id generator such as [xid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xid-js). 

Update the user model in `schema.prisma`: 

```
model User {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  orgId    Int?
  externalId String?
  email    String
  password String?
  name     String
  Todo     Todo[]
  org      Org?    @relation(fields: [orgId],  references: [id])
  active   Boolean?
 @@unique([orgId, externalId])
}
```

Now that we have the user table with the necessary fields, we'll need to edit the `seed_script.ts` file. In this workshop, we'll design our SCIM server code to be extensible for supporting multiple separate organizations. Provisioning multiple separate orgs accommodates your customers who may be using different identity providers with different SCIM clients. By giving each organization its own endpoint and API token, we ensure that no org can accidentally update or overwrite another org's users.

Let's update the users in `seed.ts`. We'll also need to hardcode `externalId` and `active` for both users. Note that `externalId`  is a unique identifier issued by the provisioning client, and must be stored in the SCIM server. The `externalId` is also considered stable because a user's name and email address can change, but its identifier in the SCIM client cannot. Along with the `active` attribute, `externalId` is not a SCIM protocol core attribute, but Okta's scim implementation expects it. The [Okta SCIM Docs](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/scim-provisioning-integration-prepare/main/#basic-user-schema) tell us that this unique identifier is the user's global id (GUID).

We'll also give each org an `apikey` set to a random string. Using a different key for each org helps our code ensure that no client can accidentally view or edit users belonging to another. 

After those changes, here's how `seed.ts` will look:

```ts
async function main() {
  const org = await prisma.org.create({
    data: {
      domain: 'portal.example',
      apikey: '131313'
    }
  });
  console.log('Created org Portal', org);
  const somnusUser = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Somnus',
      email: 'somnus@portal.example',
      password: 'correct horse battery staple',
      orgId: org.id,
      externalId: '22',
      active: true
    },
  })
  console.log('Created user Somnus', somnusUser)

  const trinityUser = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'Trinity',
      email: 'trinity@portal.example',
      password: 'Zion',
      orgId: org.id,
      externalId: '23',
      active: true
    },
  })
  console.log('Created user Trinity', trinityUser)
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Now we are ready to seed the database. If you already added records to the database, you can run `npx prisma migrate reset` to remove them. Once your database is empty, seed it by running `npm run init-db`.

A neat feature with Prisma is the option to view the user table locally. To do this, go to the root of this workshop folder, and run `npx prisma studio`. Your browser should open to a web page where you can see all the tables you've created. 


## Add a SCIM file and create a scimRoute

For maintainability, we should keep our SCIM implementation code in one place. Let's create a SCIM file, `scim.ts`, in`apps/src/assets`, and import it in `main.ts`. As a result, your `scim.ts` file will look like this: 

```ts
import { Router } from 'express';
export const scimRoute = Router();
```

And you'll import the routes in `main.ts` like this:

```ts
import { scimRoute } from './scim';
app.use('/scim/v2', scimRoute);
```

Note: `/scim/v2` will append to every SCIM route. You can change this static path as needed, as there isn't a specific URL path explicitly required by the SCIM spec. However, [Okta's SCIM Docs](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/scim-provisioning-integration-prepare/main/#base-url) recommend using `/scim/v2` unless unusual factors in your environment necessitate a different URL. 

## Build the SCIM interface

We'll need to build each CRUD endpoint required by the SCIM spec and format the responses in JSON. After that, we'll test our functions with Postman to see that they provide the responses required by the spec. 

We'll need to use express and Prisma in `scim.ts`, so import them:

```ts
import express from 'express';
import { Prisma, PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
```

Some SCIM endpoints in `scim.ts` will return user information from the Todo app's database. To easily retrieve this information from the SCIM endpoints, implement an `IUserSchema` interface and instantiate it as the defaultUserSchema. The information in the `IUserSchema` matches the SCIM spec, as you'll see soon.  

To simplify the example code, we'll support one org at first, by hardcoding the org ID as 1. When you're ready to support multiple SCIM clients, you can easily replace this constant value with a function to look up the correct org ID based on based on the context of the request. In addition, when an IdP instructs our SCIM server to create a user, the user's org ID will be hardcoded to 1 when they are created in the database. An update to support multiple organizations would also need to update the user creation code to associate them with the correct organization, as well. 

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

// To funnel users into their designated orgs
const ORG_ID = 1;
interface IUserSchema {
  schemas: string[];
  userName?: string;
  id?: string;
  name?: {
    givenName: string;
    familyName: string;
  };
  emails?: { primary: boolean, value: string, type: string }[];
  displayName?: string;
  locale?: string;
  meta?: {
    resourceType: string;
  }
  externalId?: string;
  groups?: [];
  password?: string;
  active?: boolean;
  detail?: string;
  status?: number;
}

const defaultUserSchema: IUserSchema = {
  schemas: ['urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User'],
  locale: 'en-US',
  groups: [],
  meta: {
    resourceType: 'User'
  }
};
```

Finally, we are ready to get started! Let's work on our first CRUD endpoint. 

## Create the route to POST a user 

Let's refer to the [SCIM spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.3) on creating a user. The spec says the IdP sends a POST request containing a "User" to the `/Users` endpoint to create a user. In response to the POST, the server signals a successful creation with an HTTP status code 201 (Created) and returns a representation of the user created. If the server determines that the creation of the requested user conflicts with existing users (e.g., a "User" resource with a duplicate "userName"), the server MUST return HTTP status code 409 (Conflict) with a "scimType" error code of "uniqueness," as per Section 3.12.

Our `/Users` endpoint can fulfill those requirements with the following code: 

```ts
// Create User Function
// POST /scim/v2/Users
// RFC Notes on Creating Users: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.3
scimRoute.post('/Users', passport.authenticate('bearer'), async (req, res) => {
  // console.log('POST: /Users');
  // Format to SCIM standard
  const newUser: IUserSchema = req.body;
  console.log(req.body)
  const { emails, password } = newUser;
  const externalId = newUser.externalId;
  const active = newUser.active;
  const givenName = newUser.name?.givenName ?? 'NAME';
  const familyName = newUser.name?.familyName ?? 'MISSING';
  const displayName = `${givenName} ${familyName}`;
  
  // Pull out primary email address
  const emailPrimary = emails.find(email => email.primary === true);
  const email = emailPrimary.value;
  console.log('email: ', email);
  
  // Set displayName to name
  const name = displayName;
  // Check if the User exists in the database
  const duplicateUser = await prisma.user.findFirst({
    select: {
      id: true,
      email: true,
      name: true,
    },
    where: {
      id,
      org: { id: ORG_ID }
    }
  });
  let userResponse: IUserSchema;
  let httpStatus = 201;
  // If there are any records returned, then we have a duplicate
  if (duplicateUser) {
    // User Found... Error
    console.log('Account Exist ID: ', duplicateUser.id);
    userResponse = {
      schemas: ['urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error'],
      detail: 'User already exists in the database: ' + duplicateUser.id,
      status: 409
    };
    httpStatus = 409;
    // res.status(200).send(userResponse);
  } else { // If we don't find one Create...
    // Create the User in the database
    const user = await prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        org: { connect: { id: ORG_ID } },
        name,
        email,
        externalId,
        active
      }
    });
    console.log('Account Created ID: ', user.id);
    userResponse = {
      ..defaultUserSchema,
      id: `${user.id}`,
      userName: user.email,
      name: {
        givenName,
        familyName
      },
      emails: [{
        primary: true,
        value: user.email,
        type: "work"
      }],
      displayName: name,
      externalId: user.externalId,
      active: user.active
    };
  }
  res.status(httpStatus).json(userResponse);
});
```

With that code saved in `scim.ts`, we have the first endpoint we can interact with. Now is the best time to test our code to ensure we are on the right track. 

To test our code, we'll be using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to make requests to our SCIM server. I'll also be adding an external tool, [Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan), that will help log HTTP requests; by doing so, we'll be able to confirm whether requests are reaching our server. 

## Test routes using Postman

We'll need to set up a few things for Postman to authenticate and interact with our local server. 

### Add Bearer Token auth to secure the SCIM routes

When testing our routes, Postman (acting as the SCIM client) will authenticate to the Todo app backend using a bearer token. To support token auth, first install the appropriate passport libraries. 

In your terminal, run: 

```
npm install passport-http-bearer
npm install @types/passport-http-bearer -D
```

Then import `passportBearer` and create a token auth strategy in `main.ts`: 

```ts
import passportBearer from 'passport-http-bearer';
const BearerStrategy = passportBearer.Strategy;

passport.use(new BearerStrategy(
  async (apikey, done) => {
    const org = await prisma.org.findFirst({
      where: {
        apikey: apikey
      }
    });

    return done(null, org);
  }
));
```

In `scim.ts`, import Passport:

```ts
import passport from 'passport';
```

And add passport's bearer token auth to each SCIM route in `scim.ts`. For example,

```ts
scimRoute.post('/Users', passport.authenticate('bearer'), async (req, res)
```

### Support Okta's SCIM content-type headers

You'll also need to install [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) for Express.js to accept `content-type application/scim+json`, because Okta sends this in the request headers instead of `content-type application/json`. We'll need this to read the request body from Okta. Note: This specific content-type header is required by [the SCIM spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.1)

On the command line, `npm install passport-http-bearer` to add the library to your project.

In `scim.ts`, import `body-parser`:

```ts
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
```
And instruct the app to use `bodyParser` for the relevant content types: 

```ts
app.use(bodyParser.json({ type: ['application/scim+json'] }));
```

Sign up for [Postman](https://identity.getpostman.com/login) or sign in to your account, and configure it to communicate with your local instance of the Todo app. 

In Postman, the request URL will be`http://localhost:3333/scim/v2/Users` if you're running the Todo app locally. In the Headers tab, add the key `Content-Type` and set its value to `application/scim+json`, and then add an additional key, `Authorization`, and set it to `Bearer 131313`.This bearer token value comes from the `apikey` variable set earlier in `seed.ts`. 

Now we are ready to test with Postman with our local server. You can also make cURL requests directly from the terminal if you prefer. 

### Test the POST request to add users

Try sending the following request to `http://localhost:3333/scim/v2/Users`:

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
  ],
  "userName": "test.user@portal.example",
  "name": {
    "givenName": "Test",
    "familyName": "User"
  },
  "emails": [
    {
      "primary": false,
      "value": "test.user@portal.example",
      "type": "work"
    },{
      "primary": true,
      "value": "test.user@portal.example",
      "type": "work"
    }
  ],
  "displayName": "Test User",
  "locale": "en-US",
  "externalId": "00ujl29u0le5T6Aj10h7",
  "groups": [],
  "password": "1mz050nq",
  "active": true
}
```

What response do you expect? If your code is working correctly, the Todo app backend will give a response with status 201 Created, and the following body: 

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
  ],
  "locale": "en-US",
  "groups": [],
  "meta": {
    "resourceType": "User"
  },
  "id": "5",
  "userName": "test.user@portal.example",
  "name": {
    "givenName": "Test",
    "familyName": "User"
  },
  "emails": [{
    "primary": true,
    "value": "test.user@portal.example",
    "type": "work"
  }],
  "displayName": "Test User",
  "externalId": "00ujl29u0le5T6Aj10h7",
  "active": true
}
```

If you send the same POST request again, re-creating an existing user, what should happen? Try it, and you'll get a 409 Conflict response, with a body like this: 

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error"
  ],
  "detail": "User already exists in the database: 5",
  "status": 409
}
```

You can repeat this testing process for each SCIM route that you implement! 

## Create the route to GET users 

According to [the SCIM spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.4), a SCIM server may return users paginated. [Okta requests users paginated]( https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/scim/scim-20/#retrieve-users) with a Start Index set to 1 and a count set to 100 per page. 

In addition, filtering by username is an OPTIONAL parameter for SCIM service providers refer to this section of [the SCIM spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2). However, Okta requires username filtering support as it checks to see if the user exists by username first before creating them. This behavior is described in more detail in the [Okta Docs](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/scim/scim-20/#create-users).

Why would a SCIM client, in this case the identity provider, ever want to ask our app's SCIM server what users it knows about? Okta keeps track of what identifiers each SCIM integration is using for each user, and stores those as the user's "externalId" Okta uses this endpoint to test whether a user exists and find out what ID the SCIM server uses for that individual, so that it can send the correct request type with the correct ID: PUT to update an existing user, or POST to create a new account for a user that wasn't previously known to the SCIM server. 

To fulfill these requirements, the sample app's backend can handle GET requests to the `/Users` endpoint in `scim.ts` like this: 

```ts
// Retrieve Users
// GET /scim/v2/Users
// RFC Notes on Retrieving Users: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.4.1
scimRoute.get('/Users', passport.authenticate('bearer'), async (req, res) => {
  // RFC Notes on Pagination: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.4
  const DEFAULT_START_INDEX = '1';
  const DEFAULT_RECORD_LIMIT = '100';
  let startIndex = parseInt(req.query.startIndex as string ?? DEFAULT_START_INDEX);
  startIndex--; // Prisma starts its indexing at 0, while Okta send starting index at 1, this is to make sure we start at 0
  const recordLimit = parseInt(req.query.recordLimit as string ?? DEFAULT_RECORD_LIMIT);
  let filterQuery: string | null = req.query.filter as string ?? null;
  let filterParams: string[] = [];
  let email = null;
  if (!!filterQuery) {
    // Get query string for filter that has operators eq
    // ?filter=userName%20eq%20%22bob%40tables.fake%22
    filterParams = filterQuery.split(' ');
    // RFC Notes on Filtering: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2
    const FILTER_EXPRESSION_LENGTH = 3;
    const FILTER_ATTRIBUTE_NAME = 0;
    const FILTER_OPERATOR = 1;
    const FILTER_VALUE = 2;
    if (filterParams.length !== FILTER_EXPRESSION_LENGTH || filterParams[FILTER_ATTRIBUTE_NAME] !== 'userName' || filterParams[FILTER_OPERATOR] !== 'eq') {
      filterParams = [];
      filterQuery = null;
    } else {
      // Email string is wrapped in "", remove the double quotes
      email = filterParams[FILTER_VALUE].replaceAll('"', '')
      console.log('Filter Detected: userName EQ ', email);
    }
  }
  let where: { org: {}, email?: string } = {
    org: {
      id: ORG_ID
    }
  };
  if (!!email) {
    where = { ...where, email };
  }
  const count = await prisma.user.count({ where });
  let usersResponse = {
    schemas: ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"],
    totalResults: count,
    startIndex: 1,
    itemsPerPage: 0,
    "Resources": []
  };
  if (count > 0) {
    const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
      take: recordLimit,
      skip: startIndex,
      select: {
        id: true,
        email: true,
        name: true,
        externalId: true,
        active: true
      },
      where
    });
    usersResponse['Resources'] = users.map(user => {
      const [givenName, familyName] = user.name.split(" ")
      return {
        ...defaultUserSchema,
        id: user.id.toString(),
        userName: user.email,
        name: {
          givenName,
          familyName
        },
        emails: [{
          primary: true,
          value: user.email,
            type: 'work'
          }],
        displayName: user.name,
        externalId: user.externalId,
        active: user.active
      }
    });
  }
  usersResponse.itemsPerPage = usersResponse.Resources.length
  res.json(usersResponse);
  console.log(usersResponse)
});
```

What will this code do if it finds the user? What if it gets a request to look up a user who doesn't exist?

### Test the GET /Users endpoint

Try using Postman to send a GET request with no body to `http://localhost:3333/scim/v2/Users`. What result would you expect? 
If you seeded your database using the provided script, the result will look like this: 

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"
  ],
  "totalResults": 3,
  "startIndex": 1,
  "itemsPerPage": 3,
  "Resources": [
    {
      "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
      ],
      "locale": "en-US",
      "groups": [],
      "meta": {
        "resourceType": "User"
      },
      "id": "1",
      "userName": "somnus@portal.example",
      "name": {
        "givenName": "Somnus"
      },
      "emails": [
        {
          "primary": true,
          "value": "somnus@portal.example",
          "type": "work"
        }
      ],
      "displayName": "Somnus",
      "externalId": "22",
      "active": true
    },
    {
      "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
      ],
      "locale": "en-US",
      "groups": [],
      "meta": {
        "resourceType": "User"
      },
      "id": "2",
      "userName": "trinity@portal.example",
      "name": {
        "givenName": "Trinity",
      },
      "emails": [
        {
          "primary": true,
          "value": "trinity@portal.example",
          "type": "work"
        }
      ],
      "displayName": "Trinity",
      "externalId": "23",
      "active": true
    },
    {
      "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
      ],
      "locale": "en-US",
      "groups": [],
      "meta": {
        "resourceType": "User"
      },
      "id": "3",
      "userName": "test.user@portal.example",
      "name": {
        "givenName": "Test",
        "familyName": "User"
      },
      "emails": [
        {
          "primary": true,
          "value": "test.user@portal.example",
          "type": "work"
        }
      ],
      "displayName": "Test User",
      "externalId": "00ujl29u0le5T6Aj10h7",
      "active": true
    }
  ]
}
```
The result lists all users in the database. 

### Test query parameters to filter by userName

Let's look up whether any users in the Todo app have the email address `trinity@portal.example`. Try sending a GET request with no body to `http://localhost:3333/scim/v2/Users?filter=userName eq "trinity@portal.example"&startIndex=1&count=100` What result do you expect? 

If you seeded your database with `seed.ts`, the result will look like this. 

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"
  ],
  "totalResults": 1,
  "startIndex": 1,
  "itemsPerPage": 1,
  "Resources": [
    {
      "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
      ],
      "locale": "en-US",
      "groups": [],
      "meta": {
        "resourceType": "User"
      },
      "id": "2",
      "userName": "trinity@portal.example",
      "name": {
        "givenName": "Trinity"
      },
      "emails": [
        {
          "primary": true,
          "value": "trinity@portal.example",
          "type": "work"
        }
      ],
      "displayName": "Trinity",
      "externalId": "23",
      "active": true
    }
  ]
}
```
### Get a user by ID

According to the [SCIM spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.1), the endpoint `/Users/[id]` can retrieve details about one particular user. If a user with the specified ID exists, the server responds with HTTP status code 200 (OK) and includes the user's information in the body of the response. It should return a 404 if no user was found with the requested identifier.  How can `scim.ts` fulfill the spec's requirements to look up users by their IDs? 

```ts
// Retrieve a specific User by ID
// GET /scim/v2/Users/{userId}
// RFC Notes on Retrieving Users by ID: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.4.1
scimRoute.get('/Users/:userId', passport.authenticate('bearer'), async (req, res) => {
  console.log('GET: /users/:userId');
  const id = parseInt(req.params.userId);
  const user = await prisma.user.findFirst({
    select: {
      id: true,
      email: true,
      name: true,
      externalId: true,
      active: true,
    },
    where: {
      id,
      org: { id: ORG_ID },
    }
  });
  let httpStatus = 200;
  let userResponse;
  // If no response from DB, return 404
  if (!!user) {
    const { id, name, email } = user;
    const [givenName, familyName] = name.split(" ");
    userResponse = {
      ...defaultUserSchema,
      id: id.toString(),
      userName: email,
      name: {
        givenName,
        familyName
      },
      emails: [{
        primary: true,
        value: email,
        type: 'work'
      }],
      displayName: name,
      externalId: user.externalId,
      active: user.active
    } satisfies IUserSchema;
  } else {
    httpStatus = 404;
    userResponse = `User ${id} not found`;
  };
  // Send Response
  res.status(httpStatus).json(userResponse);
  console.log(userResponse);
});
```
### Test looking up a user by their ID

With Postman, send a request to look up the user with ID 1. What URL should you hit to look up that user? What type of request should you send? 

A GET request to `http://localhost:3333/scim/v2/Users/1` will look up the appropriate user. A successful response should look like this: 

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
  ],
  "locale": "en-US",
  "groups": [],
  "meta": {
    "resourceType": "User"
  },
  "id": "1",
  "userName": "somnus@portal.example",
  "name": {
    "givenName": "Somnus"
  },
  "emails": [
    {
      "primary": true,
      "value": "somnus@portal.example",
      "type": "work"
    }
  ],
  "displayName": "Somnus",
  "externalId": "22",
  "active": true
}
```
## Support updating user info

Section 3.5.1 of the  [SCIM spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.5.1), tells us how to update a user's information if we know their ID. Users are updated by a PUT to the `/Users/[id]` endpoint. if the user exists, the server updates its records for the user and responds with HTTP status code 200 (OK), including the user's latest information in the body of the response. If no user with the specified ID is found, the server returns a 404.

Can you implement this behavior in the Todo app's backend? One way to do it would be to add this code to `scim.ts`: 

```ts
// Update a specific User (PUT)
// PUT /scim/v2/Users/{userId}
// RFC Notes on Updating a User: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.5.1
scimRoute.put('/Users/:userId', passport.authenticate('bearer'), async (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);

  const id = parseInt(req.params.userId);
  const userCount = await prisma.user.count({
    where: {
      id,
      org: { id: ORG_ID },
    }
  });
  let userResponse;
  let httpStatus = 200;
  if (userCount === 1) {
    const updatedUserRequest: IUserSchema = req.body;
    const { name, emails } = updatedUserRequest;

    const updatedUser = await prisma.user.update({
      data: {
        email: emails.find(email => email.primary).value,
        name: `${name.givenName} ${name.familyName}`
      },
      where: {
        id
      }
    });
    const [givenName, familyName] = updatedUser.name.split(" ")

    userResponse = {
      ...defaultUserSchema,
      id: id.toString(),
      userName: updatedUser.email,
      name: {
        givenName,
        familyName
      },
      emails: [{
        primary: true,
        value: updatedUser.email,
        type: 'work'
      }],
      displayName: updatedUser.name,
      externalId: updatedUser.externalId,
      active: updatedUser.active
    } satisfies IUserSchema;
  } else if (userCount === 0) {
    httpStatus = 404;
    userResponse = `User ${id} not found`;
  } else {
    httpStatus = 500;
    userResponse = `Whoa there!`;
  }
  res.status(httpStatus).send(userResponse);
});
```
Does this code make any changes to the incoming data when updating a user? What errors will it catch if the update fails? 

### Test updating a user

Let's change our user with ID 3. First, do you remember how to use Postman to look up a user's information when you know their ID? Look up the user with ID 3 now. 

As your GET request to `http://localhost:3333/scim/v2/Users/3` revealed, this person is named Test User. Let's update their `userName`, `givenName`, and primary email to `newTest User`.

To make this update, use Postman to send a PUT request to `http://localhost:3333/scim/v2/Users/3`, with the following body: 

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
  ],
  "locale": "en-US",
  "groups": [],
  "meta": {
    "resourceType": "User"
  },
  "id": "3",
  "userName": "newtest.user@portal.example",
  "name": {
    "givenName": "newTest",
    "familyName": "User"
  },
  "emails": [
    {
      "primary": true,
      "value": "newtest.user@portal.example",
      "type": "work"
    }
  ],
  "displayName": "Test User",
  "externalId": "00ujl29u0le5T6Aj10h7",
  "active": true
}
```

What response do you expect? You should get an HTTP 200 with a body like this: 

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
  ],
  "locale": "en-US",
  "groups": [],
  "meta": {
    "resourceType": "User"
  },
  "id": "3",
  "userName": "newtest.user@portal.example",
  "name": {
    "givenName": "newTest",
    "familyName": "User"
  },
  "emails": [
    {
      "primary": true,
      "value": "newtest.user@portal.example",
      "type": "work"
    }
  ],
  "displayName": "newTest User",
  "externalId": "00ujl29u0le5T6Aj10h7",
  "active": true
}
```
## Support deleting users

Section 3.6 of the  [SCIM spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.6), tells us that service providers may choose to permanently delete users with a 204 (No Content). If no user with the specified ID is found, the server returns a 404 (Not found).

When a user leaves an organization, some identity providers will delete that user entirely. Revoking the user's access to all applications is an essential component of securely offboarding them. Additionally, when an enterprise purchases a subscription plan for a SaaS app with a limited number of seats, they expect that removing a user from that app will free up a seat in their license for another user to gain access.

Deleting accounts of removed users can help your application comply with data retention regulations. And over time, storing and backing up information every user who has ever used your app, instead of only tracking active accounts, can get expensive in both storage costs and backup/restore process duration. 

Here's how you can implement user deletion in `scim.ts`:

```ts
// Delete Users
// DELETE: /Users/:userId
// RFC Notes on Deleting Users: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.6 
scimRoute.delete('/Users/:userId', passport.authenticate('bearer'), async (req, res) => {
  const id  = parseInt(req.params.userId);
  await prisma.user.delete({
    where: { id }
  });
  
  res.sendStatus(204);
});
```
### Test deleting a user 

Test out the delete function by making a DELETE request with an empty body to `http://localhost:3333/scim/v2/Users/3`.

What response do you expect? You should get an HTTP 204 with no body in response.

### Test soft deleting/"deprovisioning" a user

Okta implements a [soft delete aka deprovision](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/scim/scim-20/#delete-users) via PUT or PATCH. This will cover the scenarios such as users reassignment from services and potentially auditing purposes. Add the following code to `scim.ts` to support what the spec calls a partial delete:

```ts
// Soft Delete Users
// PATCH: /Users/:userId
// RFC Notes on Partial Update: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644#section-3.5.2 
// Note: this does not a true "delete"; this will update the active flag to false (this is an Okta best practice)
scimRoute.patch('/Users/:userId', passport.authenticate('bearer'), async (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);
  
  const id  = parseInt(req.params.userId);
  const active = req.body["Operations"][0]["value"]["active"]
  await prisma.user.update({
    data: {
      active
    },
    where: { id }
  });
  
  res.sendStatus(204);
});
```

Try sending a PATCH request with an empty body to `http://localhost:3333/scim/v2/Users/2`.

```json
{
  "schemas": [
    "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"
  ],
  "Operations": [
    {
      "op": "replace",
      "value": {
        "active": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Just like the delete request, you should expect to receive a 204 response; this is in line with [Okta's docs](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/scim/scim-20/#update-a-specific-user-patch)

## Connecting with an Identity Provider

Now that we have a working SCIM application, let's test it with an Identity Provider! In this workshop, we're using Okta. 

We'll need to set up a few things for Okta to authenticate and interact with our local server. 

### Test locally using a tunnel

One way to give your app a public URL or IP would be to host it on a cloud instance with DNS that you control. For development purposes, you can use Ngrok or Localtunnel to provide a public address to the app running on your own computer.

Since some firewalls restrict Ngrok traffic, we'll use [Localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me) in this demonstration. To run the tunnel, you'll start the api with the following command:

```
npm run serve-api
```

In another terminal, start the tunnel using:

```
npx localtunnel --port 3333
```

It will ask for permission to install the npm package; say yes. And when you start localtunnel, it will print a URL to your terminal, such as http://unique-url-for-squirrels. You will need that URL when we create a SCIM app in Okta so that Okta can send requests to your Todo app.

### Create a SCIM application in Okta

Log in to your [Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/login/), or sign up if you don't have one yet. 

In this step, you will create an app integration in Okta. Although there are several ways to create apps, we will demonstrate the workflow you would use for an app that will eventually be published to customers on the Okta Integration Network. Don't worry, we won't submit the sample app to the integration network! 

Log in to your Okta Developer Account. Make sure you're in the admin console -- when you're in the admin console, the URL will be "dev-youraccountid-admin.okta.com". Under Applications in the sidebar, click **Applications**, and click the blue "Browse App Catalog" button on the Applications page. 

Use the search box to look up "SCIM 2.0 Test App". Select the Test App with Header Auth, and hit the blue "Add Integration" for the "SCIM 2.0 Test App (Header Auth)". 

In the Sign-On Options tab of the SCIM Test App, give the app a helpful name in the Application Label field. You can keep the default or change it to SCIM Workshop. Leave the "automatically log in when a user lands on login page" box checked, and click Next. 

In the Sign-On Options dialogue, keep the default settings, as these won't be used by our app. Click the blue "Done" button at the bottom of the page. 

In the Provisioning tab of the application, click the Configure API Integration button, check the Enable API Integration box. Provide the Base URL, which is the localtunnel URL with `/scim/v2` appended to the end. The API Token is `Bearer 131313` if you're using the values seeded by `seed.ts`. Save these settings.

 When you save these settings or use the "Test API Credentials" button, Okta will make a `GET /Users` request with the API token you've provided in order to establish a connection with your SCIM server. 

Finally, under the Provisioning tab, click the "To App" heading in the left sidebar.In the Provisioning To App settings, check the boxes to enable`Create Users`, `Update User Attributes`, and `Deactivate Users`.  Leave the Sync Passwords setting disabled, with its box un-checked, for now.

## Test common user lifecycle operations

We are now ready to test common user lifecycle requests using the Okta SCIM server.

### Import users

As you know, we have two users: `somnus@portal.example` and `trinity@portal.example`, in our SCIM server. Let's sync them over to Okta so that we have visibility of all users. We can also designate Okta as the source of truth for info about users assigned to this app or organization. 

In the Import tab of the SCIM Test App in Okta, click the Import Now button. This will give an error telling you that only users with last names can be synchronized with Okta. How can you fix this error? 

One solution would be to directly add surnames in the database with Prisma, but you could also use SCIM! Try using Postman to update each user in the Todo app and give them surnames. 

Once all users in your Todo app have their first and last names set, try the Import Now button again.  When the import succeeds, Okta will make a request to get all users and confirm those already not recorded. In the list of users to import, check the boxes by those you want to sync to Okta, and click Confirm Assignments. Then go to the Assignments tab and watch as the imported users appear. 

### Sync from Okta to the Todo app

In order to sync a user that exists in Okta but not our app, we'll first need to create a user in Okta. In the Directory tab of the Okta Admin Console sidebar, click People, and use the Add Person button on the People page. Add a person with the default User type `User`, Tom Anderson,  `tom.anderson@portal.example`, and Save.  

You can now go back to your SCIM Application in the Applications list under Applications in the sidebar. In the Assignments tab of your app, click the blue Assign button and select Assign to People in the dropdown menu. Click Assign next to Tom Anderson in the user list, and click "Save and Go Back" to accept the defaults if prompted for a User Name.  Use the blue Done button to save your changes. 

In your Todo App's server logs, you'll see that a POST request immediately appeared from Okta to create Tom Anderson's account on the Todo server. 

### Deprovision a user

Let's say Tom decides to leave Portal, so we need to deprovision him from the application. 

In the Assignments tab of the Okta SCIM application, use the blue X next to Tom's entry to unassign him from the app. This unassignment makes Okta send the Todo App PATCH request, setting the unassigned user's `active` attribute to `false`. This indicates that a user's account has been suspended. 

We can confirm that Tom's `active` attribute is now `false` in the Todo app's database through the Prisma web interface.

### Reprovision a user

Let's say Tom later decides to return to Portal and needs access to this Todo app again. 

To reactivate Tom's account, we will repeat the steps for assigning his Okta account to the application.  Re-activating Tom causes Okta to send a PATCH request to our app, setting his  `active` attribute to `true`. 

Again, we can confirm that Tom's account is now `active`  through our Prisma database web interface.

### Change a user's info in Okta

Let's look at one more scenario. Let's say not only has Tom returned, but he has also changed his name! Worry not, as our SCIM connection will automatically propagate this profile update. Let's change Tom's name to Leo and watch how Okta sends the new name to the SCIM server built into our Todo app. 

In the Directory tab of the Okta admin console sidebar, navigate to People, and click on Tom's name in the user list to edit his settings. Under Profile, click "Edit" in the Attributes pane. Change the `firstName` field to Leo, and update his `login` and `email` to `leo.anderson@portal.example`. Use the blue Save button at the bottom of the page to save your changes. 

In your Todo app logs, what request do you expect to see from Okta when a user's information is updated? You should see the PUT request to your `/scim/v2/Users/4` endpoint shortly after saving Leo's new name. 


## Tool recommendations for development 

While troubleshooting and developing an application, it can be helpful to use tools that let you inspect your code's behavior closely, including the way it handles secrets. These tools helped me as I developed the sample code used in the workshop, and might help you as you build your own projects. 

The features that make these tools excellent for testing also make them terrible for use in production. In a production context, security is essential. For troubleshooting production services, integrate your application with your team's secure logging and secrets management infrastructure. 

### Public URLs for local apps

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is my favorite solution for giving an app a public address, but it's not allowed by all networks. When ngrok isn't supported, [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me) is a good alternative. Plus, localtunnel doesn't require an account to use it.

### View requests to and from the app

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is also my favorite tool for viewing requests to and from a local server. Unfortunately, some firewalls and corporate policies prohibit ngrok. If you can't use ngrok, use Okta's [system logs](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Reports/Reports_SysLog.htm) to see requests from the app to Okta. [Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) can help you log inbound HTTP requests to the server.

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is a powerful tool for examining all network traffic, including HTTP requests. 

### Testing server behavior

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/) offer a friendly interface for sending custom request bodies and headers to a server. If you prefer to work in the terminal, cURL can do the same things with the right arguments passed to it. 

## Debugging running code

If you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE, I recommend enabling your built-in debugger tool. This will allow you to inspect the request body by adding breakpoints as needed. 

Follow [Visual Studio Code's docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) to find the Run And Debug view. I used the following `launch.json` configuration for Visual Studio when working on this app:

```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Node App",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "port": 3333
    },
  ]
}
```

The version of Nx workspace tooling the application uses has a [bug when running the debugger](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/15159). Replace the Todo app's `apps/api/webpack.config.js` with the following to facilitate debugging through Visual Studio Code: 

```ts
const { composePlugins, withNx } = require('@nx/webpack');
const path = require('path')

// Nx plugins for webpack.

## Adding SCIM support to SaaS applications

Congratulations, you've added SCIM support to an OIDC application! Not only have you supported SCIM for a single Okta organization, but the implementation choices made throughout this workshop prioritize scalability so that the Todo app can integrate with as many additional identity providers as necessary! By giving every integration its own unique SCIM endpoint and API token, you prepare your application to seamlessly integrate with as many customers as you want. Keep in mind, IdPs that support SCIM may implement SCIM differently, so you will need to reference the specific IdP's implementation docs.

If you have followed along with the workshops so far, you now have a Todo application secured by OpenID Connect with SCIM provisioning. Your users can now authenticate securely with OIDC and make use of this application once they have been provisioned and assigned to the application from an Identity Provider such as Okta.
