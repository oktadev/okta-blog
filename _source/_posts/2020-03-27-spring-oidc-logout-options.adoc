On the Okta blog, we spend much of our time talking about logging in. That is because once you configure your application to log in, the log out just works. But there are a few things you should consider when you're thinking about your app's logout configuration. In this post, I'll walk through examples of the two logout options you have with Spring Security: the "default" session clearing logout, and relying party initiated logout.

If you are new to OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC), check out link:/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc[An Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect] to learn more!

**Prerequisites:**

* Java 8+
* An https://developer.okta.com/signup/[Okta Developer Account] (free forever)

== Spring Security's Default Logout

By default, when logging out of a Spring application, Spring removes the current session (technically it invalidates it) along with the corresponding session cookie (typically `JSESSIONID`). Finally, Spring redirects the user to a new page (which by default is `/login?logout`). Other than removing any ID and access tokens from your application's session, nothing OAuth 2.0/OIDC specific happens.

NOTE: The examples below are configured to redirect to the root page `/`.

== What is RP-Initiated Logout

RP-Initiated Logout is a bit of a mouthful, but the RP means relying party, which in OAuth 2.0/OIDC terms is just your application. Simplified, this means your application triggers the end of the session with your identity provider (IdP). Some folks refer to this as "SSO Logout" because this would end the session for any applications configured for single sign-on (SSO).

This flow does everything the above "default" logout does, but, instead of redirecting to a page with the application, it redirects to the IdP, where the IdP performs its logout action, and then finally redirects back to your application.

The redirect URI looks like this, where the `post_logout_redirect_uri` is the page to return to in your application.

https://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/logout?id_token_hint=<id-token>&post_logout_redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/
----

After hearing this explanation, you might be thinking, isn't that what I want? Why is that not the default? My answer is usually, "it depends, but probably not."

== Which Logout Option is Right for Me?

Nobody likes the answer "it depends," so I'll give you a couple of common examples.

I think social authentication is one of the easiest ways to see the difference between the use cases. With social authentication, your application isn't controlling the user's session with the IdP, only the session within your application. A more concrete way to look at it is Google wouldn't allow your application's logout to also log you out of your Gmail. Most corporate SSOs and portals work this way too. In that case, you might want to go with the default logout option.

On the flip side, if you only have a single application, then from a user's perspective, that is the only way they interact with the IdP so that RP-Initiated logout could be the right choice.

== Enough Already‚ÄîShow Me Some Code

I've built a simple Spring Boot app that has two pages, a landing page at `/` that anyone can access, and a `/profile` page that requires authentication to view. This application also uses Thymeleaf, but that is an implementation detail; we are only going to be looking at the security configuration.

Grab the project from https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-logout-example.git[GitHub]:

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-logout-example.git
cd okta-spring-logout-example
----

== Create an Okta OIDC Application

Log in to your Okta dashboard, (if you just signed up, Okta will email login instructions to you) then:

* Go to **Applications** > **Add Application**
* Select **Web** and click **Next**
* Give it a name like `Spring Logout Example` and change the Login redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta`
* Make sure **Logout redirect URIs** is set to `http://localhost:8080`
* Click **Done**

Your app's settings should look as follows.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-oidc-logout-options/spring-boot-oidc-settings.png' %}[alt=Spring Boot OIDC Settings,width=700,align=center]

You will find your **Client ID** and **Client secret** on this page. Copy them into `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.issuer-uri={yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-id={client-id-from-above}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-secret={client-secret-from-above}
----

WARNING: Never store secrets in source control! Spring Boot supports many different https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config[options to load configuration].

For example the same configuration with environment variables would be:

[source,sh]
----
SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OKTA_ISSUER_URI={yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OKTA_CLIENT_ID={client-id-from-above}
SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET={client-secret-from-above}
----

Start the application with `./mvnw spring-boot:run` and browse to `\http://localhost:8080/` in a private/incognito window.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-oidc-logout-options/example-app-no-session.png' %}[alt=Example App screenshot,width=700,align=center]

Click the **Login** button.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-oidc-logout-options/example-app-with-session.png' %}[alt=Example App with user logged in,width=700,align=center]


Now the fun part. Click the **Logout** button. The app has logged you out and sent you back to `/`. However, if you press the **Login** button again, you will be automatically logged in; this is because only your application's session was deleted, not the session with Okta.

TIP: If you inspect the network traffic in your browser, you will see you redirected back to your Okta Organization and then back again.

== Configure RP-Initiated Logout with Spring Security

If you open `src/main/java/com/okta/example/LogoutExampleApplication.java`, you will see the following WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class:

====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
static class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()

                // allow anonymous access to the root page
                .antMatchers("/").permitAll()

                // all other requests
                .anyRequest().authenticated()

                // After we logout, redirect to root page,
                // by default Spring will send you to /login?logout
                .and().logout().logoutSuccessUrl("/")

                // enable OAuth2/OIDC
                .and().oauth2Login();
    }
}
----
====

Change this class to:

====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
static class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    ClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrationRepository; // <1>

    OidcClientInitiatedLogoutSuccessHandler oidcLogoutSuccessHandler() { // <2>
        OidcClientInitiatedLogoutSuccessHandler successHandler = new OidcClientInitiatedLogoutSuccessHandler(clientRegistrationRepository);
        successHandler.setPostLogoutRedirectUri(URI.create("http://localhost:8080/"));
        return successHandler;
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()

                // allow anonymous access to the root page
                .antMatchers("/").permitAll()

                // all other requests
                .anyRequest().authenticated()

                // RP-initiated logout
                .and().logout().logoutSuccessHandler(oidcLogoutSuccessHandler()) // <3>

                // enable OAuth2/OIDC
                .and().oauth2Login();
    }
}
----
<1> Inject the `ClientRegistrationRepository`
<2> Create a `OidcClientInitiatedLogoutSuccessHandler`
<3> Replace `logoutSuccessUrl("/")` with `logoutSuccessHandler(oidcLogoutSuccessHandler())`
====

Restart the application and log in and out a few times. You will be prompted to log in every time you press the **Login** button.

== Bonus: Use the Okta Spring Boot Starter

If you are using the https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot[Okta Spring Boot Starter], you can configure an RP-Initated Logout by setting the `okta.oauth2.postLogoutRedirectUri` property such as:

[source,properties]
----
okta.oauth2.postLogoutRedirectUri=http://localhost:8080/
----
