Firebase is an exciting cloud platform from Google available to businesses today.  Firebase connects everything from simple static websites to IoT devices to AI and machine learning platforms. The platform provides various services to facilitate these connections, like storage and authentication.

In this tutorial, you will learn about two core Firebase products: Cloud Functions for Firebase and Firebase Hosting. Hosting is for deploying static web applications. Functions are the Firebase serverless platform.  You will create a static application using React that authenticates users via Okta's React library. After obtaining an access token from Okta's authorization server, you will use a Firebase function to exchange the Okta token for a Firebase token and sign in the user using Firebase's authentication structure. You will obtain additional user information by calling the `userInfo` endpoint on your Okta authorization server and including that data in your Firebase token. Finally, you will create another function endpoint to handle a simple HTTP request that requires an authenticated user.

Once you've built your application, you will deploy it to the Firebase platform for public consumption using the Firebase CLI.  

**Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Firebase Account](https://firebase.google.com)
- [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)
> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) offers Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)

If you wish, you can follow along with the [GitHub repository found here](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-firebase-serverless-example).

{% include toc.md %}

## Add authentication using OIDC

{% include setup/cli.md type="spa" framework="React" loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000/login/callback" %}

The CLI outputs the Issuer and Client ID. You'll need those coming up.

## Create your Firebase project

Next, open the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) and click **Add Project**. Give your project a name, preferably `okta-firebase`. For now, you can turn off the analytics and create the project. Once that's completed, you'll be able to access the project dashboard.  

First, click the **Upgrade** button next to the *Spark* option at the bottom of your screen. Change your plan to Blaze and if you wish, set a billing budget for $1 to let you know when you are incurring a charge. Blaze is pay-as-you-go, and the rates are pretty generous for hobby projects. You shouldn't incur any charges at this time, but the budget will let you know if you do.

Click the settings wheel next to *Project Overview* and click **Project settings**. At the bottom of the overview page, there's a prompt to **Select a platform to get started** and select web app (it will look like *</>*). Give your app the nickname `okta-firebase-demo` and select **Also set up Firebase Hosting for this app**. Click **Register app**, and in a moment you will see some JavaScript code for setting up your Firebase app.

{% img blog/react-firebase-serverless/firebase-config.jpg alt:"Firebase configuration generated by Firebase console under 'Add Firebase SDK' step" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Hold onto this information as you will need it in your app. Click through the rest of the wizard and return to your console. Again go to the **Project settings** section and navigate to the *Service accounts* tab. Click **Generate new private key** and let that file download. You will need this in your Firebase Function shortly.

{% img blog/react-firebase-serverless/firebase-admin.jpg alt:"Screenshot of 'Firebase Admin SDK' view with a button to 'Generate new private key'" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Finally, click the **Build**>**Authentication** in the side nav and click **Get Started**. Pressing the **Get Started** button generates a **Web API Key** that is required for using the auth features. 

## Create your front end in React

Next, create your React app.  

```console
npx create-react-app@5 okta-firebase
cd okta-firebase
```

The npx command will scaffold a new React version 18 application for you.  

Next, you will need to install a few dependencies to help you.

```console
npm i @okta/okta-react@6.4.3
npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@6.2.0
npm i react-router-dom@5.3.0
npm i bootstrap@5.1.3
npm i firebase@9.8.1
```

First, you want to install the `@okta/okta-react` package to assist in authenticating users and obtaining the tokens from the Okta authorization server. This package will help you access the authentication state, direct users to the Okta login page, and handle any callbacks.

`@okta/okta-react` relies on the `@okta/okta-auth-js` package, so you need to install it.

Next, you want to install `react-router-dom`. This package will set up the callback route for you and any other routes you may need.  

Finally, you will use the `firebase` package to call the various platform features in Firebase, such as functions and authentication.  

Add a file called `.env` in your root directory and replace the code with the following.

```
REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientID}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APIKEY={yourFirebaseAPIKey}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTHDOMAIN={yourFirebaseAuthDomain}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECTID={yourFirebaseProjectID}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGEBUCKET={yourFirebaseStorageBucket}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGINGSENDERID={yourFirebaseMessagingSenderID}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APPID={yourFirebaseAppID}
REACT_APP_ENV=production
```

You obtained the Okta values when you created your application using the Okta CLI earlier. Your Okta domain is part of the Issuer. The Firebase values came from the configuration you copied when you first created your application.

There is currently a known error in React 18 with the Okta React library where multiple rerenders can lead to an error message in the `oktaAuth` object. Work on fixing this error is ongoing. In the meantime, you can work around it by taking React out of `strict` mode. Replace the code in your `index.js` file with the following code.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
    <App />
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();

```


Next, open your `App.js` file and replace the code with the following.

```jsx
import "./App.css";

import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import AppWithRouterAccess from "./AppWithRouterAccess";
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';


function App() {

  return (
    <Router>      
      <AppWithRouterAccess />
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You are replacing the default code with a `Router` and an `AppWithRouterAccess` that you will write next. Open a new file called `AppWithRouterAccess.jsx` and add the following code.

```jsx
import "./App.css";

import { Route, useHistory } from "react-router-dom";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";
import { Security, LoginCallback } from "@okta/okta-react";

import Home from "./Home";

const {
  REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER,
  REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID
} = process.env;

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER,
  clientId: REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID,
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + "/login/callback",
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
});

function AppWithRouterAccess() {
  const history = useHistory();

  const restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) => {
    history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin));
  };

  return (
    <Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}>
      <Route path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback} />
    </Security>
  );
}

export default AppWithRouterAccess;
```

This file will define your routes and establish the `/login/callback` route for Okta to handle signing in your users.

Finally, add the `Home.jsx` file to your application with the following code.

{% raw %}
```jsx

  const getGrades = async () => {

    const resp = await getGradesCall({
      name: selectedSemester.split(" ")[0],
      year: selectedSemester.split(" ")[1],
    });

    setReportCardData(resp.data);
  };

  const exchangeOktaTokenForFirebaseToken = async () => {
    const exchangeToken = httpsCallable(
      functions,
      "exchangeOktaTokenForFirebaseToken"
    );

    const resp = await exchangeToken({

This page will handle both the authenticated and unauthenticated states. If the user is not authenticated, they are presented with a screen requesting them to do so. If the user is authenticated, they can `getGrades` by selecting a semester from the drop-down and calling the server.

The `getGrades` function ensures the user is authenticated using the build-in authentication function in Firebase. Firebase also integrates with authentication tokens from providers such as Okta. To utilize this functionality, you will mint a Firebase authentication token using an Okta authentication token. Okta returns an `accessToken` to the client when the user logs in. The client then passes the `accessToken` to a Firebase function called `exchangeOktaTokenForFirebaseToken`. In this Cloud Function for Firebase, you verify the token and return a Firebase token to log the user in. Then subsequent calls to the functions will treat that user as logged in to Firebase.

At this point, you can use the `npm run start` command to run your app locally. You'll see a few console errors from Firebase, and you'll see **Login** buttons. Notice that you're able to authenticate with Okta now, but the login process doesn't call Firebase yet, so your login is still incomplete.  

## Make your React application ready for Firebase

Now you are ready to prepare your application for Firebase. If you haven't done so yet, please install the Firebase CLI.

```console
npm install -g firebase-tools@11.1.0
```

To log in with your Google account, you may need to run `firebase login`.

Next, run the command `firebase init` to start the initialization of your project.  

Select both of the following features:
  * **Functions: Configure a Cloud Functions directory and its files**
  * **Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys**

Select **Use an existing project** and select your `okta-firebase-{ID}` project

After a moment, you'll see prompts to set up Firebase functions. Select the following options:
 1. Language - **Javascript**
 2. EsLint - **No** (You should use this in production-ready applications.)
 3. When prompted to install dependencies say **Yes**

Next, select the following options to set up hosting.
 1. What do you want to use as your public directory? - **build**
 2. Configure as a single-page app?  **yes**
 3. Setup automatic builds?  **no**

Before deploying your application, you must run the `build` command on your React app to prepare it properly. By configuring your app as a SPA, you tell the Firebase CLI to edit the configuration to redirect to `/index.html`.  

## Add authenticated Firebase functions

You should notice that a new folder called `functions` has been added to your directory. There, you will see some Firebase config stuff and a file called `index.js`. You're going to add the code for two functions.  

First, you will need one that accepts an Okta token and returns a Firebase token for the client to use. To verify the token, you will use the `@okta/jwt-verifier` package from Okta.  

The second function will accept arguments from the client, namely the semester, and use that along with some information from the token to build report card data for the client to use to create the report card.  

Start by navigating to your functions directory and installing your dependencies.

```console
cd functions
npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@2.3.0
```

The `@okta/jwt-verifier` will verify your JWT from Okta when calling the `exchangeOktaTokenForFirebaseToken` function.  

Next, copy the keys file you downloaded from the Firebase console earlier and add it to your `functions` folder. Make a note of the name, as you will need that shortly.

Add a file to your `functions` folder called `grades.js` and add the following code.

```javascript
const getGrades = (user, semester) => {
  return {
    name: user.name,
    school: getFakeUniversityName(user.email),
    semester: semester.name,
    year: semester.year,
    grades: grades
      .filter((r) => r.year == semester.year)
      .filter((r) => r.semester == semester.name),
  };
};

const getFakeUniversityName = (email) => {
  const number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);
  const domain = parseDomain(email);

  switch (number) {
    case 0:
      return "University of " + domain;
    case 1:
      return domain + " State University";
    default:
      return "University of " + domain;
  }
};

const parseDomain = (email) => {
  const emailParts = email.split("@");
  const domainParts = emailParts[1].split(".");

  let name = "";

  domainParts.forEach((part, i) => {
    if (i > 0) {
      name += " ";
    }
    if (i + 1 < domainParts.length) {
      name += part.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + part.slice(1);
    }
  });

  return name;
};

First, `exchangeOktaTokenForFirebaseToken` will provide a custom token from Firebase to use in your application. Firebase allows you complete control over your authentication via the `signInWithCustomToken` method you used on the client. You need to create a custom token using your service account. You downloaded your service account definition as a JSON file earlier. Now you can call `createCustomToken` from your `auth` object against your service account. This function requires a `uid` and optionally accepts other claims you may wish to add.  Be mindful that [Firebase reserves token names](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/create-custom-tokens#reserved_custom_token_names).  

You can then obtain a token from the Okta authorization server and present it to the Firebase function to be verified using the `OktaJwtVerifier`. If the Okta token is valid, you will call your Okta authorization server's `userInfo` endpoint to obtain additional information about your user. You can include this information in your Firebase token as its custom claims. Then you can use the `firebaseApp` object to create your token with those claims. You'll return this token to the client and sign in with it. 

Next, you have the `getGrades` function. You check `context.auth` to see if the user is logged in. If they aren't, you are throwing an error. If they are, allow the user to access the grades data in that file.  

There are two different ways to set up functions in Firebase, `onCall` and `onRequest`. `onRequest` gives you a more raw form of handling the incoming call. You'd need to set up your CORS code, your authentication, and all the good stuff that the `onCall` wrapper takes care of for you. For example, `context.auth` is provided because you used the `onCall`, whereas through `onRequest` you would need to obtain this information manually.  

## Test your app locally using Firebase emulators

Now you are ready to test your application locally through the Firebase emulator. The emulator will make it so that your services can communicate as though they were deployed to Firebase.

First, edit your `.env` file to replace `REACT_APP_ENV=production` with `REACT_APP_ENV=development`. This change tells the application to connect to the emulator. Next, run the following commands in your project's root directory.

```console
npm run build
firebase emulators:start
```

First, you need to build your application since Firebase expects your application to be in the `build` directory as you configured earlier. Next, it will create an emulator and deploy your function and web application to that emulator. By default, the web app deploys to `localhost:5000` rather than the usual `localhost:3000`.

If you find that you have conflicts with the default ports that Firebase uses, you can update the `firebase.json` file entries for `emulators.functions.port` and `emulators.hosting.port` to ports that you have available. See below for an example `firebase.json` file that uses port 5002 for hosting and 5001 for functions.

```JSON
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  },
  "functions": {
    "source": "functions"
  },
  "emulators": {
    "functions": {
      "port": 5001
    },
    "hosting": {
      "port": 5002
    },
    "ui": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

You'll need to open the Okta admin console and navigate to your Okta application to add these ports to the allowlist.

Open [Okta Developer Portal](https://developer.okta.com/) and **Sign in to Okta**. Then press **Admin** to launch the admin console. 

Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and find your Okta application for this project. Select it to edit. On the **General** tab, **Edit** the General Settings with the new ports. For example, if your Firebase hosting port is 5000, add `http://localhost:5000/login/callback` to *Sign-in redirect URIs* and `http://localhost:5000` to your *Sign-out redirect URIs*. Update the port number based on your Firebase emulator settings and save. 

There's one more place to add the new port in the Okta admin console. You'll add the port as a Trusted Origin so your app can complete the logout process. Navigate to **Security** > **API** and open the **Trusted Origins** tab. Press the **+ Add Origin** button and add the new URL with the port, such as `http://localhost:5000/`. Select the **Redirect** and **CORS** checkboxes and save, then return to your application.

At this point, you should be able to log in to Okta, exchange your token for a Firebase token, select a semester, and click **Get Grades** to see your report card generate.

## Deploy your application to Firebase

Once this works, you are ready to deploy your application to Firebase. First, set your `.env` entry for `REACT_APP_ENV` back to `production` if you had set it to `development`. You may need to run the `npm run build` command once more in case you've made any edits or changes. Once complete, run the command `firebase deploy` from your root directory.  

After completing this step, your CLI will provide a URL to your application. You should see your application running on Firebase if you click that. But, Okta won't work at this point. You need to go back to your Okta admin portal, under your application, and add `{yourFirebaseDomain}/login/callback` to your *Sign-in redirect URIs*, `{yourFirebaseDomain}` to your *Sign-out redirect URIs* to the **General Settings** tab of your Okta application, and add {yourFirebaseDomain} as a **Trusted Origin**  

Now return to your application in Firebase and click **Sign In** to ensure Okta is hooked up correctly. Once you are signed in, you should be able to select a semester and click **Get Grades** to see your report card generated.
