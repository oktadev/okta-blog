## Introduction to Server Blazor apps

[Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor) is an exciting new technology from Microsoft that will allow developers to bring C# to clients. Server and client components are written in the same language and can be used and re-used interchangeably. Blazor comes in two flavors, server and client apps. In this tutorial you will be working with [Server Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-6.0) apps, where the C# code is run on the server, and messages are exchanged using `SignalR`.

I'll show you how to integrate Okta with a server-side Blazor app. Then you will learn how to use Okta's multi-factor authentication system to provide an additional layer of security. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a technology in which a user must present two or more credentials before they can successfully gain access to complete a login or other transaction.   There are a number of ways this can be accomplished.  The most common is to email or text message a code to a user after the user is authenticated.  The user can then verify the code thus establishing that the user knows the proper credentials but also has access to the phone number or email address of record.

### What you'll need

- Your favorite IDE (I will be using Visual Studio 2019, but Visual Studio Code is another great option.)
- A [git repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)
- .NET [5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0)
- An [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)
- The [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com/) tool

## Create your Okta application

Using the Okta CLI, [create a new Okta app](https://cli.okta.com/manual/apps/create/) for .NET Blazor. Or, use your Okta admin portal to accomplish this: Navigate to **Applications**, click on `Create App Integration`, select **OIDC** for `Sign in Type`, **Web** for `Application Type`, and fill out the specifics for your localhost environment.

{% include setup/cli.md type="web" note=note framework="ASP.NET Core"
   loginRedirectUri="https://localhost:44378/authorization-code/callback"
   logoutRedirectUri="https://localhost:44378/signout/callback" %}

Once you have completed an Okta application setup you will need to enable multi-factor authentication and then enable it on your application. Now, navigate to the admin portal and under *Applications* select the application you just created. Click on **Sign on** and under the *Sign on Policy* section click on **Add Rule**.  

Under the *Access* section click on **Multifactor Settings**. For this application you will only be enabling **SMS Authentication** but you can see the **Factor Types** that Okta allows on this page. Under the **SMS Authentication** tab set the drop-down to **Active**.

{% img blog/blazor-server-side-mfa/image1.jpeg alt:"SMS Multifactor page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Return to the **Rule** page and click **Prompt for factor** and then click **Every sign on**. Give your new rule a name and click **Save**. This sign-on policy will now trigger for anyone who attempts to sign on to this application.

{% img blog/blazor-server-side-mfa/image2.jpeg alt:"Actions page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## Create your Blazor application

Open Visual Studio 2019 and select **Create a new project**. Find the **Blazor App** entry on the *Create a project* page.  Please note, if you are using a different version of Visual Studio your project create templates may look different.

{% img blog/blazor-server-side-mfa/image3.jpeg alt:"Create new project" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Under the **Create a new Blazor app** section select **Blazor Server App** and give it a minute to set up.

{% img blog/blazor-server-side-mfa/image4.jpeg alt:"Configure new project" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Once it does you will see the *Configure your new project* screen.  Name your project **Okta_ServerDemo** and press **Create**.

{% img blog/blazor-server-side-mfa/image5.jpeg alt:"Create Blazor app" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

After setup is complete, take a minute to run the application and see how Blazor is set up. For this tutorial, the demo application that comes with Blazor setup is enough. We will need to make some changes to the application though.

## Set up your application

First install the `Okta.AspNetCore` package from NuGet via the Command Line or NuGet package manager. This will make integration with Okta quick and easy.

```shell
Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 4.0.0
```

Next, open `appsettings.Development.json` and edit the code with the following.

```JSON
{
  "DetailedErrors": true,
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}"
  }
}
```

If you don't know where to find the values for your Okta settings, you should be able to find them in `.okta.env`. You can also retrieve them from the Okta admin console.

You can now alter your `Startup.cs` to configure authentication using Okta.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Okta_ServerDemo.Data;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;

namespace Okta_ServerDemo
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddRazorPages();
            services.AddServerSideBlazor();
            services.AddSingleton<WeatherForecastService>();

            services.AddAuthentication(options =>
            {
                options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
            })
           .AddCookie()
           .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
           {
               OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue<string>("Okta:Domain"),
               ClientId = Configuration.GetValue<string>("Okta:ClientId"),
               ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue<string>("Okta:ClientSecret"),
               Scope = new List<string> { "openid", "profile", "email" },
           });
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            else
            {
                app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
                // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
                app.UseHsts();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();

            app.UseStaticFiles();

            app.UseRouting();

            app.UseAuthentication();
            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
            {
                endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
                endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
            });
        }
    }
}
```

## Write your application

Next, you can turn your attention to the pages. First, you will want to edit `App.razor` with the following code.

```xml
<CascadingAuthenticationState>
    <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly" PreferExactMatches="@true">
        <Found Context="routeData">
            <AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)">
                <Authorizing>
                    <p>Determining session state, please wait...</p>
                </Authorizing>
                <NotAuthorized>
                    <h1>Sorry</h1>
                    <p>You're not authorized to reach this page. You need to log in.</p>

                    <UserComponent></UserComponent>
                </NotAuthorized>
            </AuthorizeRouteView>
        </Found>
        <NotFound>
            <LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)">
                <p>Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
            </LayoutView>
        </NotFound>
    </Router>
</CascadingAuthenticationState>
```

Much of this page is boilerplate from the setup process. But you need to make a few important changes. First, wrap the entire code in the `CascadingAuthenticationState` element. This will cascade the authentication state to each of your routes. Next, you need to change `RouteView` to `AuthorizeView` and handle the `Authorizing` and `NotAuthorized` states.  

At this point, you may have noticed that `UserComponent.razor` doesn't exist, so create that now in the `Shared` folder. Add the following code to it.

```xml
<AuthorizeView>
    <Authorized>
        <a href="logout">Log out</a>
    </Authorized>
    <NotAuthorized>
        <a href="login?redirectUri=/">Log in</a>
    </NotAuthorized>
</AuthorizeView>
```

This component makes use of the `CascadingAuthenticationState` from above and presents two different views. If the user is logged in, then you display a logout button. If the user is unauthorized, present them with a login button.

The two routes here, `login` and `logout` need to be implemented next. Under **Pages**, add a new `RazorPage` called `Login`. Razor pages are created with two components, a `cshtml` file and a `.cs` file. Since your login page is hosted by Okta you do not need any presentation in the `.cshtml` file. However, you still need to tell the page which model file to use. Open `Login.cshtml` and add the following code.

```.cshtml
@page
@model Okta_ServerDemo.Pages.LoginModel


@{
   
}
```

Next, open `Login.cshtml.cs` and add the login logic.

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_ServerDemo.Pages
{
    public class LoginModel : PageModel
    {
        public async Task OnGet(string redirectUri)
        {
            await HttpContext.ChallengeAsync(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme, new AuthenticationProperties
            {
                RedirectUri = redirectUri
            });
        }
    }
}
```

This code should look familiar if you've used Okta with any ASP.NET application. You're simply returning the `Challenge` provided by Okta. This will redirect the user to the Okta login page.  

After you authenticate, you'll either be asked for your phone number or prompted to send a code to your phone. This depends on whether you've set up your phone in Okta yet. If you haven't, add your phone number to your account and verify the code; otherwise, click **Send Code** and then verify the code on this page. And just like that, your application is now secure with MFA using Okta! You can select several MFA methods found on [Okta's site](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/mfa/mfa-home.htm), ranging from email and phone codes to physical authenticators.  

Now you can add the `Logout` page the same way you added the `Login` page. Again, since there is no presentation here your `.cshtml` file will declare the model page without any HTML.

```cshtml
@page
@model Okta_ServerDemo.Pages.LogoutModel
@{
}
```

Your `Logout.cshtml.cs` file will contain the stock ASP.Net Core logout logic.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_ServerDemo.Pages
{
    public class LogoutModel : PageModel
    {
        public SignOutResult OnGet()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(
                new[]
                {
                     OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                     CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
                },
                new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" });
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, the `Counter` and `FetchData` pages will require user authentication.

Open `Counter.razor` and add the `@attribute [Authorize]` annotation.

```razor
@page "/counter"

@attribute [Authorize]

<h1>Counter</h1>

<p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}
```

This code is almost identical to the boilerplate code except for the `Authorize` attribute at the top of the page. Like ASP.Net Core, this attribute will require the user to be logged in before accessing it.

Similarly, edit the `FetchData.razor` file with the following code.

```razor
@page "/fetchdata"

@using Okta_ServerDemo.Data
@inject WeatherForecastService ForecastService

@attribute [Authorize]

<h1>Weather forecast</h1>

<p>This component demonstrates fetching data from a service.</p>

@if (forecasts == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Date</th>
                <th>Temp. (C)</th>
                <th>Temp. (F)</th>
                <th>Summary</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            @foreach (var forecast in forecasts)
            {
                <tr>
                    <td>@forecast.Date.ToShortDateString()</td>
                    <td>@forecast.TemperatureC</td>
                    <td>@forecast.TemperatureF</td>
                    <td>@forecast.Summary</td>
                </tr>
            }
        </tbody>
    </table>
}

@code {
    private WeatherForecast[] forecasts;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        forecasts = await ForecastService.GetForecastAsync(DateTime.Now);
    }
}
```

Again the only change here is the addition of the `Authorize` attribute.

## Test your application

Now start the application and navigate to the `Counter` page.

{% img blog/blazor-server-side-mfa/image6.jpeg alt:"Application not authorized" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

You will see the message found on your `App.razor` page. Click on the **Login** button and walk through the authentication and MFA process. Once you're logged in, you should be presented with the `** page.  

{% img blog/blazor-server-side-mfa/image7.jpeg alt:"Application is authorized" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }
