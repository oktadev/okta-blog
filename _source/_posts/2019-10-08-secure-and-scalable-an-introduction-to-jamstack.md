If you're a web developer, chances are you have heard the term "JAMstack." Curiously, JAMstack isn't a solution to prevent clogged printers, something to eat on toast, or a way to make music. However, by the time you finish reading this tutorial, you'll understand JAMstack and its benefits, and learn one approach to implementing JAMstack for yourself. _Let's get ready to JAM._

The "JAM" in JAMstack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. JAMstack's pattern of architecture makes web applications less expensive to build and more secure, with better performance and scalability.

JAMstack does not dictate you switch to any particular technology. You can use any JavaScript library or technology that compiles to JavaScript (e.g. TypeScript, Elm, Clojure, or WebAssembly). JavaScript can fetch data or send updates to third-party APIs, your own API, Serverless functions, or any combination of APIs. For managing content, you can choose from a variety of static site generators, such as Hugo, GatsbyJS, Jekyll, Next.js, Nuxt.js, or VuePress, and write content using Markdown or any other markup system that renders as HTML.

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/secure-and-scalable-introduction-to-jamstack.png alt:"JAMStack" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## JAMstack is Fast, Scalable, and Less Expensive

Traditional web applications and Content Management Systems (CMS) rely on server-side code to render and return HTML on every request. Often times, these systems include a database or other type of dynamic storage, adding another layer of latency. Scaling a traditional system with more servers and ensuring high availability is no trivial task. Add to this the complexity of caching, such as invalidating the cache when content or code changes, and it's a recipe for heartburn.

With the JAMstack approach, every page is compiled (or built) ahead of time when the application is deployed. All the HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and images required for the application are fully "baked" ahead of time.The goal is to avoid as much server executed code as possible because serving static files is faster and far simpler than executing server-side code.

These static files can additionally be globally cached across a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Most of the traffic falls on the CDN at dramatic cost savings over maintaining your own server infrastructure. In addition, visitors receive content from servers that are located closest to them, which can have a big impact on responsiveness, satisfaction, and conversions!

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/traditional-web-vs-jamstack.jpg alt:"JAMStack vs Server-Side Code" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## JAMstack is More Secure

Traditional server-side and CMS applications expose lots of APIs and services to allow administrators to manage data and content. All of these are at risk of attack and require continuous effort to patch and maintain.

On the other hand, static files are read-only and not susceptible to the same types of attacks. There is no code to run, so no vulnerabilities to exploit!

Even "A" in JAMstack (APIs) exposes a minimal attack surface area because there's less code to secure and maintain and yourapplication can use APIs provided by a third-party. Presumably, any third-party service will diligently monitor and maintain the security and availability of their services.

## Build Your First JAMstack with Hugo

Most JAMstack applications start with a decision on how to manage content and generate static resources. There are lots of options available in almost every programming language. [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/) is a curated list of static site generators and a great starting place for research.

In this tutorial, we are going to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It's extremely fast and flexible. It's written in Go, but it's not likely you'll need to learn the Go language to customize it for your needs.

### Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, there are a few things you will need.

* Depending on your operating system:
 * **Windows**: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
 * **macOS**: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
 * **Linux**: [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* If you don't already have a favorite code editor, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* A forever free [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)

### Install Hugo

The first step is to install Hugo. Hugo is a command-line interface (CLI) application that you will run in a command prompt, terminal, or PowerShell.

#### Chocolatey (Windows)

```bash
choco install hugo -confirm
```

#### Homebrew (macOS) or Linuxbrew (Linux)

```bash
brew install hugo
```

### Create a New Hugo Application

In your terminal, change to a folder where you want to store your new application. Then, use the Hugo CLI to create the application.

```bash
hugo new site jamstack-demo
```

The previous command will create a new folder named `jamstack-demo`.

#### Add a Theme to Hugo using Git

There are a lot of great themes available for Hugo (see [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/) for more examples). In this tutorial, you will use the [Tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme) theme.

```bash
cd jamstack-demo
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme.git themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme
```

#### Update Hugo Configuration

Open the `jamstack-demo` project in your favorite code editor. Under the folder `/themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/exampleSite`, you should see a file named `config.toml`. Open this file, select/highlight all the content, and copy the content.

Next, open the site's `/config.toml` file, delete the current configuration, and paste in the configuration from the theme's example site. Feel free to update the title or the author information.

#### Create a New Post

In your terminal, use the Hugo CLI app to create a new post.

```bash
hugo new post/hello-world.md
```

In your editor, you will find the new post under `/content/post/hello-world.md`. Hugo uses Markdown for managing content. At the top of the Markdown file is the "front matter" or metadata about the post - add some content to the file below the front matter and save the file.

```md
---
title: "Hello World"
date: 2019-08-20T12:55:13-04:00
draft: true
---

Hey! This is my first post in Hugo!
```

#### Launch the Hugo Server

Go back to your terminal and launch the Hugo web server with the following command. Hugo will build the site and start a local web server you can use for testing.

```bash
hugo server -D
```

By default, the local web site should be available at `http://localhost:1313`. Open your browser and navigate to the URL output at the terminal. By default, this should be `http://localhost:1313`. Switch back to your editor, make a change to the post, and save the file. Hugo should detect the change and automatically refresh the web site!

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/hello-world-hugo-site.jpg alt:"Hello World Hugo Site" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## JavaScript and APIs

We now have a good foundation for the [M]arkup in JAM. Now let's talk about [J]avaScript and [A]PIs. The files may be static, but once it is delivered to the client, the experience can be as dynamic as you like. The sky's the limit!

Or, perhaps the *cloud* is the limit? Heh heh... get it? *[cough]* Right, let's move on.

One fundamental concern for most web applications is how to manage user accounts and control access to protected data. Features such as user registration, login, password reset, and profile management are not trivial to implement on your own. Thankfully, there are great third-party solutions you can plug into your application to take all those worries away.

## Add Okta Authentication and Identity to Hugo

With Okta, you can "...add authentication, authorization, and user management to your web app within minutes." The first step is to [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) for a free developer account.

### Create an Okta Application

Once you've registered and logged into your Okta developer dashboard, click on the **Applications** menu, and click **Add Application**.

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/okta-01-add-application.jpg alt:"Add application" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click on the **Native** application platform. The reason for choosing **Native** is this option supports the latest Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) standard, which is more secure. Then, click **Next**.

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/okta-02-native-application.jpg alt:"Add native application" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Change the application **Name** to whatever you desire. Update the **Login redirect URIs** to `http://localhost:1313/login/`. Click **Done**.

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/okta-03-application-settings.jpg alt:"Application settings" width:"759" %}{: .center-image }

#### Copy the Client ID

You should now find yourself on the application settings page for the application you just created. Near the bottom, you should see a section labeled **Client Credentials**. Copy the **Client ID** and save it somewhere handy. You'll need this value later.

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/okta-04-clientid.jpg alt:"Copy the Client ID" width:"753" %}{: .center-image }

#### Add A Trusted Origin

To enable the Hugo application to exchange information with Okta, you need to configure Okta to permit the application's URL. First, click on the **API** menu and click **Trusted Origins**.

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/okta-05-api-trusted-origins.jpg alt:"API trusted origins" width:"717" %}{: .center-image }

Next, click **Add Origin** and name the Origin `JAMstack Demo`. Change the **Origin URL** to `http://localhost:1313`. Click to enable both **CORS** and **Redirect**. Last, click **Save**.

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/okta-06-trusted-origin-settings.jpg alt:"Add trusted origin" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

#### Enable Self-Service Registration

To allow new users to create their own accounts, you'll need to enable self-service registration. To do this, click on the **Users** menu and click **Registration**.

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/okta-07-users-registration.jpg alt:"Users Registration menu" width:"410" %}{: .center-image }

Click on the **Edit** button, change the **Self-service registration** to **Enabled**, and then click the **Save** button at the bottom.

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/okta-08-user-self-service-registration.jpg alt:"Enable self-service registration" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

#### Copy the Organization URL

The last bit of information you need from your Okta account is your **Org URL**. Click on the **Dashboard** menu. On the right side of the page, you should see your account's **Org URL**. Copy this URL and save it somewhere handy. You'll need this value later, too.

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/okta-09-org-url.jpg alt:"Okta Org URL" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## Customize Hugo to Add Okta Login

Now that the Okta application is set up and ready, you can add Okta registration and login to your Hugo site. This will involve customizing the theme templates, creating a new Login page, and adding the Okta Sign-In Widget.

### Add Okta Application Settings to Hugo Configuration

Open the `/config.toml` file and find the section under the comment `# Menu Configuration`. After the **About** menu item, add the following configuration.

```toml
[[menu.main]]
 weight = 6
 identifier = "login"
 name = "Login"
 pre = "<i class=\"sidebar-button-icon fa fa-lg fa-lock\"></i>"
 url = "/login"
```

At the very end of the `config.toml` file, add a new `[params.okta]` section with the following information. Update `{yourOktaClientId}` and `{yourOktaOrgUrl}` with the values you saved earlier.

```toml
 [params.okta]
   clientId = "{yourOktaClientId}"
   baseUrl = "{yourOktaOrgUrl}"
   redirectUri = "http://localhost:1313/login/"
```

### Add JavaScript Files

Under the `/static` folder, create a new folder named `js`. In this folder, create a new file named `okta-login.js` and add the following JavaScript to this file. This JavaScript file will only be used with the login page itself.

```js
// using jQuery, wait for the document to finish loading
$(document).ready(function () {
 // grab the Okta config injected by /layouts/partials/script.html
 var config = window.okta.config;

 // create an instance of the Okta Sign-In widget
 var signIn = new OktaSignIn({
   clientId: config.clientId,          // required okta config
   baseUrl: config.baseUrl,            // required okta config
   redirectUri: config.redirectUri,    // required okta config
   authParams: {
     display: 'page',
     responseType: 'code',             // authParams set to use PKCE
     grantType: 'authorization_code'
   },
   features: {
     registration: true                // allow user self-registration
   }
 });

 // test to see if the current request is a redirect back from Okta login
 function isRedirect() {
   return /((code|state)=)/.test(window.location.hash);
 }
  // get the active login session
 function getSession() {
   return signIn.authClient.session.get()
     .then(function (session) {
       if (session.status === "ACTIVE") {
         return session.user().then(function (user) {
           return {
             session,
             user
           }
         });
       }
       return { session, user: {} };
     })
     .catch(function (err) {
       console.error("session error", err);
     });
 }

 function showWelcomeMessage(profile) {
   $('#okta-login-firstname').html(profile.firstName)
   $('#okta-login-success').show();
 }

 // assign a click function to the sign out button
 $('#okta-sign-out').click(function() {
   signIn.authClient.session.close().then(function() {
     location.reload();
   });
 });

 if (isRedirect()) {
   // parse the token passed back from Okta
   signIn.authClient.token.parseFromUrl()
     .then(function (res) {
       var accessToken = res[0];
       var idToken = res[1];
       // set tokens for the active session
       signIn.authClient.tokenManager.add('accessToken', accessToken);
       signIn.authClient.tokenManager.add('idToken', idToken);

       // use the Okta API to get the current user
       return getSession()
         .then(function(res) {
           // show welcome message
           showWelcomeMessage(res.user.profile);
         })
         .catch(function (err) {
           console.error("getSession error", err);
         });
     })
     .catch(function (err) {
       console.error("parseFromUrl error", err);
     });
 } else {
   // try getting the active session
   getSession()
     .then(function(res) {
       if (res.session.status === 'ACTIVE') {
         // session is active, so show the welcome message
         showWelcomeMessage(res.user.profile);
         return;
       }
       // session is not active, so show the login widget
       signIn.renderEl({ el: '#okta-login-container' });
     })
     .catch(function(err){
       console.error(err);
     });
 }
});
```

Add a new file named `okta.js` to the `/static/js` folder with the following JavaScript. This code will be used everywhere on the site *except* on the login page.

```js
// wait for the page to load
$(document).ready(function () {
 // create an instance of the Okta Sign-In widget
 var config = window.okta.config;
 var signIn = new OktaSignIn({
   clientId: config.clientId,
   baseUrl: config.baseUrl,
   redirectUri: config.redirectUri
 });

 // function to get the active login session, if exists
 function getSession() {
   return signIn.authClient.session.get()
     .then(function (session) {
       if (session.status === "ACTIVE") {
         return session.user().then(function (user) {
           return {
             session,
             user
           }
         });
       }
       return { session, user: {} };
     })
     .catch(function (err) {
       console.error("session error", err);
     });
 }

 function showWelcomeMessage(profile) {
   $('#okta-info .firstName').html(profile.firstName);
   $('#okta-info').show();
 }

 // if there's an active login session, show the welcome message
 getSession()
   .then(function(res) {
     if (res.session.status === 'ACTIVE') {
       showWelcomeMessage(res.user.profile);
     }
   })
   .catch(function(err){
       console.error(err);
   });
});
```

### Customize Theme Templates

Under the `/layouts` folder, create a new folder named `partials`. Inside the `partials` folder, create a new file named `okta-login.html`. Add the following HTML to this file.

```html
<div id="okta-login-container"></div>
<div id="okta-login-success" style="display:none;">
 <h2>Welcome, <span id="okta-login-firstname"></span>!</h2>
 <p>You are currently logged in.</p>
 <p><button id="okta-sign-out">Sign Out</button></p>
</div>
```

Under the `/layouts` folder, create a new folder named `login`. Under `/layouts/login`, add a new file named `login.html` and add the following HTML to this file.

{% raw %}
```html
{{ partial "head.html" . }}
<body>
 <div id="blog">
   {{ partial "header.html" . }}
   {{ partial "sidebar.html" . }}
   {{ partial "post/header-cover.html" . }}
   <div id="main" data-behavior="{{ .Scratch.Get "sidebarBehavior" }}"
     class="{{ with .Params.coverimage }}hasCover{{ end }}
            {{ if eq .Params.covermeta "out" }}hasCoverMetaOut{{ else }}hasCoverMetaIn{{ end }}
            {{ with .Params.coverCaption }}hasCoverCaption{{ end }}">
     <article class="post">
       <div class="post-header main-content-wrap {{ if $.Params.metaalignment }}text-{{ $.Params.metaalignment }}{{ else }}text-left{{ end }}">
         <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="headline">
           {{ $.Title }}
         </h1>
         {{ partial "okta-login.html" . }}
       </div>
       {{ partial "footer.html" . }}
     </article>
   </div>
 </div>
{{ partial "foot.html" . }}
```
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
> Note: This is essentially the same template file as `/themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/layouts/_default/single.html`, but with the guts of the `<article></article>` changed to only include the `{{ $.Title }}` and new `{{ partial "okta-login.html . }}`.
{% endraw %}

#### Override Theme Templates

The next three template files will be modified copies of their respective originals. When Hugo renders a site, it first looks for template files in the site's `/layouts` folder. Any file found in the `/layouts` folder overrides the same relative named file under the theme's `layouts` folder (`/themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/layouts/`).

Add a new file to `/layouts/partials` named `script.html`. Open the original `script.html` file located at `/themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/layouts/partials/script.html` and copy the contents of the original file into `/layouts/partials/script.html`. Then, at the very bottom of the new `script.html` file, add the following markup.

{% raw %}
```html
{{ if ( isset .Site.Params "okta" ) }}
 <script src="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/3.1.0/js/okta-sign-in.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 <script>
   window.okta = {
     config: {
       clientId: '{{ .Site.Params.okta.clientId }}',
       baseUrl: '{{ .Site.Params.okta.baseUrl }}',
       redirectUri: '{{ .Site.Params.okta.redirectUri }}'
     }
   }
 </script>
 {{ if eq ( replace ( .Permalink | relURL ) "/" "" ) "login" }}
   <script src="/js/okta-login.js"></script>
 {{ else }}
   <script src="/js/okta.js"></script>
 {{ end }}
{{ end }}
```
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
Add a new file to `/layouts/partials` named `head.html`. Similar to the previous step, copy the original HTML located at `/themes/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/layouts/partials/head.html` into the new `head.html` file. At the end of the file, add the following HTML *before* the `{{ partial "head_end.html" . }}` tag.
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
```html
   {{ if .Site.Params.okta }}
     <link href="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/3.1.0/css/okta-sign-in.min.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/>
   {{ end }}
```
{% endraw %}

Create a new file under `/layouts/partials` named `footer.html`. Add the following HTML to the file.

{% raw %}
```html
<footer id="footer" class="main-content-wrap">
   <div id="okta-info" style="display: none; text-align: center;">
       Hi, <span class="firstName"></span>!
   </div>
   <span class="copyrights">
       &copy; {{ now.Format "2006" }} {{ with .Site.Params.footer.copyright }}{{ . | safeHTML }}{{ else }}{{ with .Site.Author.name }}{{ . }}{{ else }}{{ with .Site.Title }}{{ . }}{{ end }}{{ end }}{{ end }}. {{ i18n "footer.all_rights_reserved" }}
   </span>
</footer>
```
{% endraw %}

### Add a Placeholder for the Login Page

Under the `/content` folder, add a file named `login.html`. Add the following markup to this file.

```toml
---
title: Login
type: login
layout: login
---
```

### Test the New Login Page

Now you're ready to test! Start the Hugo server if it's not still running and browse to `http://localhost:1313`. You should see a new menu item on the left labeled `Login`. Click on this menu, and you should see the login form. Try logging in with the same Okta account you registered with, or try adding a new account using a different email address.

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/hugo-okta-login.jpg alt:"Hugo Login with Okta" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

After you login to your Okta account, you should see the welcome message on the `/login` page. Click on the **Home** menu, and you should see a personalized message displayed in the footer area.

{% img blog/secure-and-scalable-an-introduction-to-jamstack/hugo-okta-login-success.jpg alt:"Hugo Login with personalized message" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

This demonstrates we can use JavaScript with the active login session to call additional Okta APIs. In this case, we're retrieving profile information that includes the user's first name.

Of course, there is so much more you can do! For example, from here you could integrate additional APIs and make requests to those using the same Okta authentication token. You could create a mashup of public and secure services.
