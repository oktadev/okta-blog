When you create React applications, at some point you have to make a decision on how to organize your CSS styles. For larger applications, you'll have to modularize the stylesheets. Tools such as Sass and Less let you divide up your styles into separate files and provide lots of other features that make writing CSS files more productive. But some problems remain. The tools separate your styles from your components, and keeping the styles up-to-date with the rest of your code can be difficult. It is hard to figure out if a large application that has been developed and modified for several years still uses a particular CSS class. It is also not easy to make sure that changing a style in one part of your application doesn't affect the appearance of some other unrelated component.

## Styled Components to the Rescue

The solution to these problems is a concept known as scoped styles. Here you write CSS styles that apply only within a well-defined context. For example, you could write styles that apply only to a single React component. The **Styled Components** library implements this concept. You can create CSS styles directly in your JavaScript code and attach the style to an HTML tag or an existing component to create a new Styled Component. The styles are scoped and apply only that component. This has a number of advantages.

* You define components and styles in one place. If you remove a component from the application, you also remove the styles at the same time.
* Styles are scoped. They apply only to a single component, although you can apply styles to child components as well.
* Styles are dynamic. You can use any JavaScript expression in your stylesheets. You can also define styles depending on component properties.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to use Styled Components in your React application by creating a simple calendar application.

**Prerequisites:**

* [Node 12](https://nodejs.org/)+
* An [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)

## Create a React App

I will assume that you have some basic knowledge of React and that you have a recent version of Node installed on your system. Node comes with a couple of utility commands. Probably the best known of these is the node package manager `npm`. Less well known is the `npx` command that lets you run commands installed in your local repository. If it can't find a command, `npx` will automatically install the commands before executing it. 

You should always use the more recent versions of the React command-line interface with `npx`. This ensures that you are always using the latest version. To create a new React application, open a terminal, navigate to a directory of your choice, and run the following command.

```bash
npx create-react-app react-styled-calendar
```

This will create a new folder called `react-styled-calendar` and initialize a React application inside of it. To create the calendar, you will be using the `moment` package. This is a powerful package for time and date manipulation. Navigate into the newly created project folder and install the `moment` package.

```bash
cd react-styled-calendar
npm install -E moment@2.25.3
```

Now open your favorite editor, create a file `src/Calendar.js`, and create a new calendar component by pasting the code below into the file.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import moment from 'moment';

export class Calendar extends Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      date: moment(),
    }
  }
}
```

Here the constructor simply initializes the component's state with the current date. The component needs a method that creates all the days of the current month. For now, you will place every day of the month into a `div` element. Add the following method into the `Calendar` component.

```jsx
createDaysOfMonth(refDate) {
  const date = moment(refDate).endOf('month');
  const lastDate = date.date();
  const firstWeekday = date.startOf('month').day();

  const calendarDays = [];

  const today = moment();

  for (let w=0; w<firstWeekday; w++) {
    calendarDays.push(<div key={Math.random()}/>); // empty days
  }

  for (let d=1; d<lastDate; d++) {
    calendarDays.push(<div key={d} today={date.date(d).isSame(today, 'day')}>{d}</div>);
  }

  while (calendarDays.length % 7 !== 0) {
    calendarDays.push(<div key={Math.random()}/>);
  }

  return calendarDays;
}
```

The first three lines figure out how many days the current month has and what day of the week the months start. A month view on a calendar typically has some empty fields at the beginning and end to account for the fact that the month doesn't always start on the same weekday. The code adds this padding by using the first `for` loop and the last `while` loop. The middle `for` loop then adds all the days of the month by creating divs containing the date number.

You now need two methods to update the components state by navigating through the months. Add the following two methods to the `Calendar` component.

```js
prevMonth() {
  this.setState({date: this.state.date.subtract(1, 'month')})
}

nextMonth() {
  this.setState({date: this.state.date.add(1, 'month')})
}
```

Now you are ready to render the calendar. The `render()` method shows the current month and year, two buttons for navigation, and then the month view. Paste the following code into the `Calendar` component.

```jsx
render() {
  return <div>
    <h2>{this.state.date.format('MMMM YYYY')}</h2>
    <div>
      <button onClick={this.prevMonth.bind(this)}>&lt;</button>
      <button onClick={this.nextMonth.bind(this)}>&gt;</button>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>Sunday</div>
      <div>Monday</div>
      <div>Tuesday</div>
      <div>Wednesday</div>
      <div>Thursday</div>
      <div>Friday</div>
      <div>Saturday</div>
      {this.createDaysOfMonth(this.state.date)}
    </div>
  </div>;
}
```

To make the component show up in your application, you need to add it to the main application component. Open `src/App.js` and replace its content with the code below.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Calendar } from './Calendar';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Calendar/>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You now have a fully functioning calendar that you can test by running the following command in the terminal.

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` and you can see your calendar. Click on the arrow buttons to browse through the months. Of course, the calendar hasn't been styled yet, so all the days appear in one long column.

## Add Authentication to Your React App

Many web applications need to be restricted to users that are registered to the service. With Okta, you can quickly set up secure authentication and control which users can access your application. In this section, I will show you how to add authentication to your React application. First, you will need to sign up for a free developer account with Okta.

Open your browser, navigate to <https://developer.okta.com>, follow the sign-in link, and complete the form that appears next. After you register, you will be taken to your Okta dashboard.

Select **Applications** in the top menu and create your first application by clicking the **Add Application** button. On the screen that appears next, select **Single-Page App** and click **Next**.

You will see a screen with settings. Make sure the port is set to 3000 and that the return URL is set to `http://localhost:3000/callback`. This is the port that your React application uses to run the development server. When you're done, click on **Done**.

The resulting screen will provide you with a client ID, which you will need to copy and paste into your application in the following steps.

Now open your terminal and install the libraries that we need to enable authentication in the calendar application.

```bash
npm install -E @okta/okta-react@3.0.1 react-router-dom@5.1.2
```

Now open `src/App.js` and update its contents to match the following code.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Calendar } from './Calendar';
import './App.css';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';

function App() {
  return (
      <Router>
        <Security issuer='https://{YourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default'
                  clientId='{ClientId}'
                  redirectUri={window.location.origin + '/callback'}
               pkce={true}>
          <SecureRoute path='/' exact={true} component={Calendar}/>
          <Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback}/>
        </Security>
      </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the code above, `{ClientId}` is the client ID that you obtained from the Okta dashboard and `{YourOktaDomain}` is your Okta domain. That's it! You set up authentication and protected the calendar application from unauthorized access. There's nothing more to it.

## Add Styled Components to Your React App

Now, it is time to add some style to your application. In this section, I'll show you how to install and use React Styled Components. First, install the `styled-components` package to your project. Open your terminal in the project root folder and run the following command.

```bash
npm install -E styled-components@5.1.0
```

Now create a new file `src/CalendarComponents.js` and create the basic components that will serve as container elements for your calendar.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';

export const CalendarWrapper = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
`;

export const CalendarContainer = styled.div`
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 800px;
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
`;
```

JavaScript's template literal mechanism creates Styled Components. Note the back-ticks surrounding the CSS strings in the code above. By prefixing a template string with one of the tags provided by `styled-components`, you create a new component. The code applies CSS to that component without affecting any other style or layout in your application. In the following button, you can see how you can nest styles and use the ampersand `&` in much the same way as you would use it in SASS.

```js
export const PagingButton = styled.button`
  display: inline-block;
  background-color: #3f51b5;
  color: #ffffff;
  font-size: 24px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  margin: 12px;
  cursor: pointer;
  &:hover {
    background-color: #334296;
  }
`;
```

You can also use expressions and make the style dependent on the properties passed to the component. The following code styles the day fields of the calendar.

```js
export const Day = styled.div`
  box-sizing: border-box;
  font-size: 24px;
  width: ${ 100 / 7 }%;
  padding: 8px;
  background-color: ${props => props.today ? '#3f51b5' : '#f0f0f0'};
  color: ${props => props.today ? '#ffffff' : '#000000'};
  border: 2px solid #ffffff;
  height: 64px;
`;
```

You might notice that the `Day` component looks to see if `props.today` is true. If it is, it assigns a different background color and text color. Finally, create a new component by adding style to an existing component. Call `styled()` with the component constructor.

```js
export const DayHeader = styled(Day)`
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 16px;
  padding-top: 12px;
  height: 48px;
`;
```

Here I passed in the Styled Component `Day`, but you could have passed in any existing React component to add style to it. 

Add the `PagingButton`, `Day`, and `DayHeader` constants to `src/CalendarComponent.js`.

Now it's time to use all of the components you have created. Open `src/Calendar.js` and, at the top of the file, import the components.

```js
import {
  CalendarWrapper,
  CalendarContainer,
  PagingButton,
  Day,
  DayHeader
} from './CalendarComponents'
```

Inside `createDaysOfMonth()`, replace all occurrences of the `div` tag with the `Day` tag. Then update the `render()` method to look as follows.

```jsx
render() {
  return <CalendarWrapper>
    <h2>{this.state.date.format('MMMM YYYY')}</h2>
    <div>
      <PagingButton onClick={this.prevMonth.bind(this)}>&lt;</PagingButton>
      <PagingButton onClick={this.nextMonth.bind(this)}>&gt;</PagingButton>
    </div>
    <CalendarContainer>
      <DayHeader>Sunday</DayHeader>
      <DayHeader>Monday</DayHeader>
      <DayHeader>Tuesday</DayHeader>
      <DayHeader>Wednesday</DayHeader>
      <DayHeader>Thursday</DayHeader>
      <DayHeader>Friday</DayHeader>
      <DayHeader>Saturday</DayHeader>
      {this.createDaysOfMonth(this.state.date)}
    </CalendarContainer>
  </CalendarWrapper>;
}
```

Note how you updated only the tags to use the new Styled Components. Nothing else has changed. Test your application again.

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser again at `http://localhost:3000` to see how your calendar looks now. After signing in with your Okta credentials, you should see something like the image below.

Congratulations! You learned the basics of how to create Styled Components and use them in your React applications.

## Learn More About React and Styled Components

In this tutorial, I showed you how to create and use Styled Components in your React application. Styled Components allow you to create scoped CSS styles that apply to only a single type of component. This creates more stable applications because changes in a component's style cannot accidentally cause style changes in an unrelated part of your application. You define the CSS in the same location as the component, which makes it easy to maintain the stylesheet code.
