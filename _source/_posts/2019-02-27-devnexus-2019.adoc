Hello, Developers! Have you ever been to the wonderful conference known as Devnexus? I attended for the first time two years ago and had a blast! It's well organized, affordable, and has a diverse and fun crowd.

This year, Okta is sponsoring Devnexus and we have a number of speakers sharing their wisdom. I thought it'd be fun to write a blog post that highlights my team members and what they'll be talking about.

If you'd like to watch, rather than read, I hope you enjoy the video below. üòä

**When:** Friday, March 8 at 9:00
**Where:** Exhibition Hall B

This keynote focuses on leadership for those who don't really wanna do it. Regardless of the technology you know, regardless of the job title you have, you have amazing potential to impact your family, workplace, community, and beyond. In this talk, David will share a few candid stories of his career failures... err... learning opportunities. You'll walk away with some essential leadership skills anyone can develop, and a good dose of encouragement to be more awesome

== JavaScript: Hey y'all, watch this! Also by David Neal
**When:** Thursday, March 7 at 10:00
**Where:** Ballroom E

This talk will be a parade of face-palm JavaScript fails, stupid JavaScript tricks, and bad jokes sure to get an eye-roll from everyone! Along the way, you may even learn a few mistakes to avoid and tips to make your own JavaScript less terrible!

This is a new talk from the very same awesome illustrator I mentioned above **David Neal**. You can find him on Twitter https://twitter.com/reverentgeek[@reverentgeek]

**When:** Thursday, March 7 at 14:40

== OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (In Plain English) by Micah Silverman

**When:** Friday, March 8 at 13:20

There's no shortage of information out there on OAuth and OpenID Connect. Much of it is not helpful for people not already familiar with the standard. This talk takes you through it all - in plain English.

In my talk, there will be lots of live coding with Spring Boot and Vue (+ TypeScript!). You'll learn how to build a Spring Boot API and secure it with Spring Security. You'll also learn how to build a Vue PWA that talks to this API and have fun doing it!
