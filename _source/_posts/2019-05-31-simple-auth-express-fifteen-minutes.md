Building web pages with user authentication can be a huge pain. You typically need to set up some sort of database to manage users even if you're not using the database for anything else. You would then need to store their password hashes, and you almost need a degree on internet security to know the safest ways to do that.

What if I told you it didn't have to be so complicated? Using Okta and Express, I'll show you how to really quickly set up a website that has secure user authentication, without the need for a separate database. Everything you need you could deploy anywhere that you can run Node.

## Create a New App in Express

Creating a new app in Express doesn't take a lot of code. You'll need to set up your project structure and install some dependencies, which you can do with just a few commands:

```bash
mkdir new-project
cd new-project
npm init -y
npm install express hbs @4.17.1 hbs@4.1.1
npm install --save-dev nodemon@2.0.4 standard@14.3.4
```

Edit the `"scripts"` section of your `package.json` to look like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "nodemon .",
  "test": "standard"
},
```

Now create a new file `index.js`:

**index.js**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();

app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'hbs');

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use('/static', express.static('public'));

// @TODO add auth middleware
// @TODO add registration page

app.use('/', require('./routes/index'));

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`App listening on port ${port}`));
```

Make a few new folders as well:

```bash
mkdir -p public/images routes views
```

Put a fun greeting image in `public/images/greeting.jpg` that you will use to greet users.

Express allows for a templating engine. You already set up Handlebars (hbs) above, so now you can create a couple of views. One will be the HTML skeleton that contains the basic markup, and the other will be your homepage (the `index` view).

**views/layout.hbs**
{%raw%}
```hbs
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <title>Simple Auth in 15 Minutes</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">
      <div class="container">
        <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">Navbar</a>
        <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNavAltMarkup" aria-controls="navbarNavAltMarkup" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
          <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNavAltMarkup">
          <div class="navbar-nav">
            {{!-- @TODO add auth links --}}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </nav>
    <main class="container pt-4">{{{body}}}</main>

    <!-- Optional JavaScript -->
    <!-- jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-ChfqqxuZUCnJSK3+MXmPNIyE6ZbWh2IMqE241rYiqJxyMiZ6OW/JmZQ5stwEULTy" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
{%endraw%}

{%raw%}
This `layout` will get rendered for each view, with the specific view replacing the `{{{body}}}` tag.
{%endraw%}

Now you can create the `index` view. This will just display the image you put in `public/images/greeting.jpg`:

**views/index.hbs**

```hbs
<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <img class="rounded img-fluid" src="/static/images/greeting.jpg" />
</div>
```

To tell the homepage to use that file when rendering, you'll also need to create a router. You already `require`d `routes/index.js` in the `index.js` file of your app, so now you just need to create that file:

**routes/index.js**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index');
});

module.exports = router;
```

The call to `res.render('index')` tells Express to use the render the `index.hbs` view and respond with the results back to the client. You can also pass in some context, but it's not needed here just yet.

Now you can run your server with the following command (as you make changes, the server will reload and you'll just need to refresh the page):

```bash
npm start
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your greeting.

## Add Authentication to Your Express App

You now have a simple web server with a homepage and a lovely greeting image. The next step I promised to show you is to add secure user authentication. This is where Okta comes in to play. Okta is a cloud service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or multiple applications. Our API enables you to:

- [Authenticate](https://developer.okta.com/product/authentication/) and [authorize](https://developer.okta.com/product/authorization/) your users
- Store data about your users
- Perform password-based and [social login](https://developer.okta.com/authentication-guide/social-login/)
- Secure your application with [multi-factor authentication](https://developer.okta.com/use_cases/mfa/)
- And much more! Check out our [product documentation](https://developer.okta.com/documentation/)

If you don't already have one, [sign up for a forever-free developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

You're going to need to save some information to use in the app. Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your application. In it, enter your organization URL.

```bash
HOST_URL=http://localhost:3000
OKTA_ORG_URL=https://{yourOktaOrgUrl}
```

You will also need a random string to use as an App Secret for sessions. You can generate this with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g uuid-cli
echo "APP_SECRET=`uuid`" >> .env
```

Next, log in to your Okta developer console, navigate to **Applications**, then click **Add Application**. Select **Web**, then click **Next**. Change all ports to be 3000 and add `http://localhost:3000/callback` as a **Login redirect URI**.

{% img blog/express-auth/create-new-application-settings.png alt:"Create New Application Settings" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

The page you come to after creating an application has some more information you need to save to your `.env` file. Copy in the client ID and client secret.

```bash
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret}
```

The last piece of information you need from Okta is an API token. In your developer console, navigate to **API** > **Tokens**, then click on **Create Token**. You can have many tokens, so just give this one a name that reminds you what it's for, like "15 Minute Auth". You'll be given a token that you can only see right now. If you lose the token, you'll have to create another one. Add this to `.env` also.

```bash
OKTA_TOKEN={yourOktaAPIToken}
```

### Add Auth Middleware to Your Express App

Okta provides some middleware that will give you information about whether the user is registered or not. It also gives you a login page by default at `/login`. Add the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install dotenv@8.2.0 express-session@1.17.1 @okta/oidc-middleware@4.0.1 @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs@3.3.1
```

In your `index.js` page, replace the `// @TODO add auth middleware` comment with the following code:

```javascript
app.use(
  require('express-session')({
    secret: process.env.APP_SECRET,
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: false
  })
);

const { ExpressOIDC } = require('@okta/oidc-middleware');
const oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
  appBaseUrl: process.env.HOST_URL,
  issuer: `${process.env.OKTA_ORG_URL}/oauth2/default`,
  client_id: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET,
  redirect_uri: `${process.env.HOST_URL}/callback`,
  scope: 'openid profile',
  routes: {
    loginCallback: {
      path: '/callback'
    },
  }
});

app.use(oidc.router);
```

Also, make sure to add the following to the very top of `index.js`. This needs to be there before any other code in order to load your environment variables, so it should be the very first line of the file:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
```

### Create a Registration Page

You should now be able to login by going to `/login` in an incognito window. This will redirect you to your Okta developer page, and after you sign in you'll be redirected back to the homepage.

For people who aren't registered yet, they'll need a registration page. At the time of this writing, Okta doesn't provide a registration page out of the box, but you can build one pretty quickly. Create a new view for your route:

**views/register.hbs**
{%raw%}
```hbs
<form method="post">
  {{#each fields}}
    <div class="form-group">
      <label>{{this.label}}</label>
      <input
        required
        name="{{this.name}}"
        type="{{this.type}}"
        class="form-control {{#if this.error}}is-invalid{{/if}}"
        value="{{this.value}}"
      />
      <div class="invalid-feedback">{{this.error}}</div>
    </div>
  {{/each}}
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Register</button>
</form>
```
{%endraw%}

You'll also need a new route:

**routes/register.js**

```javascript
const okta = require('@okta/okta-sdk-nodejs');
const express = require('express');

const router = express.Router();

const client = new okta.Client({
  orgUrl: process.env.OKTA_ORG_URL,
  token: process.env.OKTA_TOKEN
});

// Take the user to the homepage if they're already logged in
router.use('/', (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.userContext) {
    return res.redirect('/');
  }

  next();
});

const fields = [
  { name: 'firstName', label: 'First Name' },
  { name: 'lastName', label: 'Last Name' },
  { name: 'email', label: 'Email', type: 'email' },
  { name: 'password', label: 'Password', type: 'password' }
];

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('register', { fields });
});

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  const { body } = req;

  try {
    await client.createUser({
      profile: {
        firstName: body.firstName,
        lastName: body.lastName,
        email: body.email,
        login: body.email
      },
      credentials: {
        password: {
          value: body.password
        }
      }
    });

    res.redirect('/');
  } catch ({ errorCauses }) {
    const errors = {};

    errorCauses.forEach(({ errorSummary }) => {
      const [, field, error] = /^(.+?): (.+)$/.exec(errorSummary);
      errors[field] = error;
    });

    res.render('register', {
      errors,
      fields: fields.map(field => ({
        ...field,
        error: errors[field.name],
        value: body[field.name]
      }))
    });
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

To tie this all together, in your root `index.js` file, make sure to replace the `// @TODO add registration page` comment with the following:

```javascript
app.use('/register', require('./routes/register'));
```

You can now have users register. If they run into an error, it will be displayed with the field that caused the error.

{% img blog/express-auth/register.png alt:"Register With Error" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

### The Default Logout Route

Okta's middleware also provides a `/logout` route. 

If you're logged in, hitting `http://localhosts:3000/logout` with a POST request will invalidate the token and delete the user's session. It will then redirect you back to the homepage. If you're not logged in, it just takes you back to the homepage.

### Add Links to the New Routes in Your Express App

To more easily expose these routes to the user, you can add some buttons. You'll need to expose the user context to the view to know if a user is logged in or not so you know which buttons to display, and potentially greet the user.

In `routes/index.js` replace the `res.render('index')` line with the following:

**routes/index.js**
```javascript
const { userContext } = req;
res.render('index', { userContext });
```

While you're at it, you can also prevent the user from seeing your greeting unless they're logged in. Change your `views/index.hbs` file to the following:

**views/index.hbs**
{%raw%}
```hbs
{{#if userContext}}
  <h1 class="text-center">Hi {{userContext.userinfo.given_name}}!</h1>
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
    <img class="rounded img-fluid" src="/static/images/greeting.jpg" />
  </div>
{{else}}
  <h1 class="text-center">Please log in</h1>
{{/if}}
```
{%endraw%}

{%raw%}
Now to add the buttons. In `views/layout.hbs`, replace the `{{!-- @TODO add auth links --}}` comment with the following:
{%endraw%}

**views/layout.hbs**
{%raw%}
```hbs
{{#if userContext}}
  <form method="POST" action="/logout">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-link nav-item nav-link">Logout</button>
  </form>
{{else}}
  <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="/login">Log in</a>
  <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="/register">Register</a>
{{/if}}
```
{%endraw%}
