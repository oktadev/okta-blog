Apple announced a Sign in with Apple service at its WWDC developer conference in June 2019. If you're familiar with social login with Google or Facebook, it's very similar. Most of these identity services use OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC), and Apple's implementation is similar. 

Today I'd like to show you how to develop a mobile application with Ionic, add OIDC authentication, retrieve the user's information, and add social login (aka federated identity) with Apple and Google. I'll even show you how to test it in a phone simulator, as well as on your device.

**Prerequisites:**

* [Node 12](https://nodejs.org/)+
* A sense of adventure

## Create an Ionic App

To begin, you'll need to install the [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/). 

```shell
npm i -g @ionic/cli@6.11.0
```

Then, use `ionic start` to create a new Angular app with tabs. You might notice this command also specifies Capacitor. Using Capacitor is the recommended way to run Ionic apps on mobile devices from 2020 onward.

```shell
ionic start ionic-social tabs --type angular --capacitor
cd ionic-social
```

Run `ionic serve` and make sure you can see the app in your browser.

## Add Authentication with OpenID Connect

The easiest way to add OIDC authentication to an Ionic app is with OktaDev Schematics. Before I show you how to do that, you'll need to create an Okta developer account and register your app to get a client ID. Head on over to [developer.okta.com/signup](https://developer.okta.com/signup) if you'd like to do this in your browser. 

If you prefer the command line, install the [Okta CLI](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-cli). Run `okta register` to sign up for a new account. 

Log in to your Okta Developer account or use `okta apps create`. If you use your browser, go to **Applications** > **Add Application**. 

On the Create New Application page, select **Native**. Name your app `Ionic Social`, and configure it as follows:
 
* Login redirect URIs: 
  * `http://localhost:8100/callback`
  * `com.okta.dev-133337:/callback` (where `dev-133337.okta.com` is your Okta Org URL)
* Logout redirect URIs:
  * `http://localhost:8100/logout`
  * `com.okta.dev-133337:/logout`
* Grant type allowed: 
  - [x] **Authorization Code**
  - [x] **Refresh Token**
* Click **Done**

If you're using the command line, you'll have to use your browser to adjust the redirect URIs. Your app's settings should look similar to the screenshot below.

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/okta-native-app.png alt:"Okta Native app settings" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

Run the following command to add a sign-in feature to your Ionic + Capacitor app. 

```shell
ng add @oktadev/schematics@2.2.0 --platform=capacitor
```

Running this command will prompt you for an issuer and client ID. If you used your browser to create an app, the client ID is displayed on your screen. You can find the issuer in your Okta dashboard at **API** > **Authorization Servers**. It usually looks something like `https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default`.
 
If you used the CLI, you should have this information in your terminal. You can run `okta apps` to see your apps and `okta apps config --app=<appName>` to get your app's info.

This process will install several dependencies and a plethora of files to handle OIDC authentication. 

```shell

You can see all the files that OktaDev Schematic adds [in its GitHub project](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/schematics/tree/main/src/add-auth/ionic/angular/src/app).

> **NOTE:** OIDC Login for Ionic is made possible thanks to the excellent [Ionic AppAuth](https://github.com/wi3land/ionic-appauth#readme) project and its examples. This integration is not Okta-specific and should work with any identity provider that supports PKCE for browser and mobile apps.

Run `ionic serve` and open `http://localhost:8100` in a new incognito window.

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/ionic-login.png alt:"Ionic with Login button" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click **Login** to sign in to your Okta developer account.

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/okta-login.png alt:"Okta Login Form" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

You'll be redirected back to your app.

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/okta-login-success.png alt:"Okta Login Success" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click **Get User Details** to fetch the user's information using the following code in `src/app/tab1/tab1.page.ts`.

```ts
public async getUserInfo(): Promise<void> {
  this.userInfo = await this.authService.getUserInfo<IUserInfo>();
}
```

Your user information will be rendered in `src/app/tab1/tab1.page.html`:

{% raw %}
```html
<ion-card *ngIf="userInfo">
  <ion-card-header>
    User Info
  </ion-card-header>
  <ion-card-content>
    {{userInfo | json}}
  </ion-card-content>
</ion-card>
```
{% endraw %}

One of the neat things you can do with your Okta developer account is add additional identity providers. This means you can add Apple as an identity source and easily add Sign in with Apple to your Ionic app!

## Configure Sign in with Apple

To begin, you must have an [Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com/). You'll need to create an App ID, a Services ID, and a private key.

### Create an App ID on Apple

Log in to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com) and go to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**. Select **Identifiers** on the left and click the blue **+** icon. Select **App IDs** and **Continue**. Select **App** and **Continue**. Enter a description and bundle ID. I used `Ionic Social` and `com.okta.developer.ionic-social`.

Scroll down and select **Sign in with Apple**, click **Continue**, and then **Register**.

### Create a Services ID on Apple

To create a Services ID (with allowed redirect URIs), go to **Identifiers** > blue **+** icon **Services IDs** > **Continue**. I used `Okta` for the description and `com.okta.developer.ionic` for the identifier. Click **Continue**, then **Register**. 

Select the identifier that you just created.

Select the **Sign in with Apple** checkbox, and then click **Configure** to define the domain your app is running on and the redirect URLs used during the OAuth flow.

Enter the domain name where your app runs in the **Domains and Subdomains** box (e.g., `dev-133337.okta.com`). In the **Return URLs** box, enter your Okta tenant's `/authorize/callback` URL, for example `https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback`. 

Click **Next**, **Done**, **Continue**, and then **Save**. 

### Create a Private Key for Client Authentication

On the **Certificates, Identifiers, & Profiles** page, select **Keys**, and then **Create a key**.

Give your key a name (e.g., `AppleLoginKey`), select **Sign in with Apple**, and click **Configure**.

Select your App ID from the **Primary App ID** drop-down box and click **Save**. Apple will generate a new private key.

Click **Continue**, **Register**, and then **Download**.

Click **Done**, and then on the **Keys** page, click the key that you just created and make a note of the Key ID. You need it in the next section.

Make a note of your Team ID in the upper-right corner of your Apple developer dashboard (just below your account name).

**TIP**: See Okta's [developer docs for Sign in with Apple](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/apple/create-an-app-at-idp/) if these steps don't work.

### Add Apple as an Identity Provider in Okta

Open your Okta developer console in a new tab and navigate to **Users** > **Social & Identity Providers** > **Add Identity Provider** > **Add Apple**. 

- **Name**: `Apple`
- **Client ID**: `com.okta.developer.ionic` (your Services ID from Apple)
- **Client Secret Signing Key**: upload the `.p8` file you downloaded
- **Key ID** and **Team ID**: available in your last tab
- **Scopes**: defaults (`name`, `email`, `openid`) are fine

Click **Add Identity Provider**. Click the arrow next to your new IdP, and you'll see its ID.

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/apple-identity-provider.png alt:"Apple Identity Provider" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Copy this ID and open `src/app/auth/auth.service.ts` in a text editor. Add `auth_extras` as a property to `authConfig` and add your Apple IdP's ID as an `idp` property.

```ts
const authConfig: any = {
  ...
  usePkce: true,
  auth_extras: {
    idp: '<your-apple-idp-id>'
  }
};
```

Restart your Ionic app and open `http://localhost:8100` in a private window. Click **Login** 
and you'll be redirected to Apple to sign in.

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/apple-login.png alt:"Apple Login Form" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Log in, and you should be redirected back to your app. 

**NOTE**: If you receive an error about `Missing fields: 'firstName','lastName'`, you'll need to remove the app from your Apple ID. On a Mac, go to **System Preferences** > **Apple ID** > **Password & Security** > Apps Using Your Apple ID > **Edit**. Go to **Ionic Social** and click **Stop Using Apple ID**. This error happens because Apple sends the name only the very first time you log in. 

Click **Get User Details**, and your info will be fetched from Apple via Okta.

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/apple-get-user-details.png alt:"Apple Get User Details" width:"750" %}{: .center-image }

It's pretty cool that you can add Sign in with Apple via Okta, don't you think?! 😀
 
But what if you want to allow people to sign up for an account and you want to manage your users? The good news is you can configure Okta as your main login screen with buttons to sign in with Apple, Google, and many other identity providers. 

**TIP**: To see how to enable user registration, see [Tutorial: User Login and Registration in Ionic > Add User Registration](/blog/2019/06/20/ionic-4-tutorial-user-authentication-and-registration#add-user-registration).

## What about Okta's Angular SDK and Sign-In Widget?

Okta provides an [Angular SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/tree/master/packages/okta-angular) as well as the [Sign-In Widget](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget). I've encountered quite a few developers that want to have an in-app login screen without popping a browser. 

The Sign-In Widget seems like a good solution for this. However, in a Capacitor app, `capacitor://localhost` is sent as an `origin` header, and Okta only allows `http` and `https` as schemas. This means the CORS request for the `./well-known/openid-configuration` metadata fails. 

I thought the [Capacitor Community's HTTP module](https://github.com/capacitor-community/http) would fix this, but [it does not](https://github.com/capacitor-community/http/issues/45). I'm currently trying to convince Okta to allow `capacitor://` as a schema for trusted origins. 

In the meantime, you can customize the Okta-hosted version of the Sign-In Widget. To do this, you need to create a custom domain.

## Create a Custom Domain and TLS Certificate with Cloudflare

To use a custom domain with Okta, you need to have access to its DNS settings and create a TLS certificate. 

Cloudflare makes this easy. [Sign up for Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) if you don't have an account.

Log in to Cloudflare and select **+Add Site**. It's best if you point a whole domain at Cloudflare. For example, I used `mattraible.com`. The free plan is good enough for this tutorial.

After transferring your domain, you'll need to create an origin CA certificate. 

1. Click the **SSL/TLS** app
2. Click the **Origin Server** tab
3. Click **Create Certificate** to open the **Origin Certificate Installation** window
4. Select **Let Cloudflare generate a private key and a CSR**
5. Change **Certificate Validity** to **1 year** (Okta will reject the certificates with a 15-year expiration)
6. Click **Next**

Copy the **Origin Certificate** to a `tls.cert` file on your hard drive. Copy the **Private key** to `private.key`. 

In Okta, go to **Customization** > **Domain Name** > **Edit** > **Get Started**. Enter a subdomain name (e.g., `id.mattraible.com`) and click **Next**. You'll be prompted to verify domain ownership. Add the specified `TXT` record on Cloudflare via the **DNS** > **+ Add record** option. 

Click **Verify** > **Next** on Okta.

For the **Certificate** field, copy/paste the contents of `tls.cert`. 

> On a Mac, you can use `cat tls.cert | pbcopy` in a terminal to copy the file to your clipboard.

Put the contents of `private.key` in the **Private key** box. Click **Next**.

You'll be prompted to add a CNAME record. Add this to your Cloudflare DNS. Click **Finish**.

**NOTE**: When I first tried this, I found that my home network caches DNS entries, and I was unable to get to `id.mattraible.com` for days. However, if I connected with my phone, I was able to load it. I grabbed the IP address when I was connected to my phone and added an entry to my `hosts` file as a workaround.

Wait until `https://<id.domain.name>` resolves in your browser before continuing.

### Configure a Custom Domain for Your Authorization Server

The OpenID Connect specification requires a `./well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint with metadata about your app's endpoints. You should be able to see yours at:
 
```
https://<id.domain.name>/oauth2/default/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

You might notice that it has your Okta `dev-*` domain, rather than your custom domain name.

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/openid-configuration.png alt:"OIDC configuration endpoint JSON" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

You need to update your authorization server to use your custom domain to fix this. Log in to your Okta account and go to **API** > **Authorization Servers** > **default** > **Edit**. Change the **Issuer** to use **Custom URL**. 

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/as-custom-url.png alt:"Authorization Server Custom URL" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

Try `./well-known/openid-configuration` again; it should have your custom domain now.

### Configure Apple to Allow Your Custom Domain

Since you've added a new domain, you've created another possible redirect URL. Log in to your [Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com) and go to the Service ID you created. Edit your service and configure Sign in with Apple. Add a new Website URL with your domain and authorize callback. 

- **Domains**: `<id.domain.name>`
- **Return URLs**: `https://<id.domain.name>/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback`

You can see the values I used below.

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/apple-website-urls.png alt:"Apple website URLs for id.mattraible.com" width:"650" %}{: .center-image }

Click **Done**, **Continue**, and **Save**.

### Configure Ionic to use Your Custom Domain

Open `src/app/auth/auth.service.ts` in your Ionic app and change the configuration to use your custom domain. Remove `auth_extras` too.

```ts
const issuer = 'https://<id.domain.name>/oauth2/default';
const authConfig: any = {
  identity_client: clientId,
  identity_server: issuer,
  redirect_url: redirectUri,
  end_session_redirect_url: logoutRedirectUri,
  scopes,
  usePkce: true
};
```

Now you can customize the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget. 

### Add Sign in with Apple to the Hosted Sign-In Widget

In Okta, go to **Customization** > **Sign-in Page**. Make sure you're using the latest version, then modify the HTML on the right. Find the line with `var config` and add the following after it, where `<apple-idp-id>` can be found at **Users** > **Social & Identity Providers** > **(>)** before Apple.

```js
config.idps = [
  {type: 'APPLE', id: '<apple-idp-id>'}
];
config.idpDisplay = "PRIMARY";
```

Scroll up and click **Save and Publish**. 

Navigate to your custom `id.domain.name`, and you should see a **Sign in with Apple** button.

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/okta-apple-signin.png alt:"Okta widget with Sign in with Apple" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## Add Social Login with Google

If you want to add Sign in with Google, you can do it with very similar steps. Rather than repeat all the steps verbatim here, I invite you to check out Okta's [Google Social Login Guide](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/google/create-an-app-at-idp/). 

**Tip**: You'll need to add `http://localhost:8100` as a JavaScript origin to sign in with Google via your browser in development.
 
After you've registered Google as an identity provider, update your sign-in page's code. 
 
```js
config.idps = [
  {type: 'APPLE', id: '<apple-idp-id>'},
  {type: 'GOOGLE', id: '<google-idp-id>'},
];
```

Click **Save and Publish**. Now you should be able to sign in with Apple or Google. How cool is that?! 😎

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/okta-apple-google-signin.png alt:"Okta widget with Apple and Google" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## Run Your Ionic App in iOS Simulator 

To build your app and run it on iOS Simulator, run the following commands:

```shell
ionic build --prod
npx cap add ios
npx cap open ios
```

Add your custom scheme to `ios/App/App/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
    <string>com.getcapacitor.capacitor</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>capacitor</string>
      <string>com.okta.$dev-subdomain</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

In Xcode, go to **App** > **Signing & Capabilities** and select your team. Then, click the ▶ button in the top left and deploy to an iPhone X. Click the **Login** button, and you should see options to sign in with Apple, Google, or your Okta credentials.

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/ionic-on-simulator.png alt:"Ionic on Simulator" width:"350" %}{: .center-image }

**NOTE:** If you want to debug your Ionic app in Simulator, you can use Safari to debug Simulator in its **Develop** menu.  

Sign in with Apple and then click the button to get your user details. You should see everything working.

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/ionic-simulator-apple-details.png alt:"Apple User Details in Simulator" width:"350" %}{: .center-image }

Google should work too!

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/ionic-simulator-google-details.png alt:"Google User Details in Simulator" width:"350" %}{: .center-image }

## Deploy Ionic App to iOS Phone

If you have an iPhone, you should be able to deploy your Ionic app to it. Plug your iPhone in via USB, and it should show up as a target in Xcode. You should see an **App** > **Your Phone Name** at the top. Click ▶ to deploy to your (unlocked) phone.

I dig the Sign in with Apple experience on my iPhone 11! iOS takes over without a redirect and makes it seamless. 

{% img blog/ionic-social-login/iphone-signin-apple.png alt:"Sign in with Apple on iPhone 11" width:"350" %}{: .center-image }

For me, Face ID is even part of the flow! 😃

## Learn More about Ionic and Social Login

I hope you enjoyed this tutorial on how to add Sign in with Apple (and Google) to your Ionic apps. The thing I dig about Okta's setup is that I can use the same identity provider for all my apps that use my authorization server. That means I only have to configure external IdPs once, and all my apps can take advantage of it.

You can find all the code for this example on GitHub in the [@oktadeveloper/okta-ionic-social-login-example repository](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-ionic-social-login-example). 

If things didn't work in this tutorial for some reason, please consult Okta's official documentation for adding Apple and Google.
