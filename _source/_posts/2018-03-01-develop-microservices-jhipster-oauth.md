JHipster is a development platform to generate, develop, and deploy Spring Boot + Angular web applications and Spring microservices. It supports using many types of authentication: JWT, session-based, and OAuth 2.0. In its 5.0 release, it added React as a UI option. 

{% img blog/microservices-jhipster-oauth/jhipster-5.png alt:"Spring Boot + (Angular | React) + Bootstrap  = JHipster" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

In addition to having two popular UI frameworks, JHipster also has modules that support generating mobile applications. If you like Ionic, which currently leverages Angular, you can use [Ionic for JHipster](/blog/2018/01/30/jhipster-ionic-with-oidc-authentication). If you're a React aficionado, you can use [Ignite JHipster](/blog/2018/10/10/react-native-spring-boot-mobile-app).

[JHipster](http://www.jhipster.tech) is 🔥, and so are microservices! Follow the instructions in this tutorial to create an API gateway, a blog microservice, and a companion store microservice.

## Install JHipster

There are six different ways to [install JHipster](http://www.jhipster.tech/installation/). The first way, [JHipster Online](https://start.jhipster.tech/), doesn't even require you to install anything. It'll generate the application and push it to a GitHub repository for you. While this works nicely, I like to have my example apps in a single repository for easier discoverability.

A local installation with Yarn or npm are other options, as is using a package manager (Homebrew on Mac, Chocalatey on Windows), using a Vagrant-based developer box, or using a Docker container. Since I'm on a Mac, I like to use Homebrew because it allows me to use JHipster with multiple Node versions without installing JHipster again. You can install JHipster on a Mac using the following command:

```bash
brew install jhipster
```

On Windows, it's as simple as:

```bash
choco install jhipster
```

Or you can use the standard npm installation:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster
```

## Generate an API Gateway

One of the new features added in JHipster 5.3.x is the ability to generate a full microservices stack using the `import-jdl` command. Open a terminal window, create a directory (e.g., `jhipster-microservices-example`) and create an `apps.jh` file in it. Copy the JDL below into this file.

```
application {
  config {
    baseName gateway,
    packageName com.okta.developer.gateway,
    applicationType gateway,
    authenticationType oauth2,
    prodDatabaseType postgresql,
    searchEngine elasticsearch,
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka,
    testFrameworks [protractor]
  }
  entities Blog, Post, Tag, Product
}

application {
  config {
    baseName blog,
    packageName com.okta.developer.blog,
    applicationType microservice,
    authenticationType oauth2,
    prodDatabaseType postgresql,
    searchEngine elasticsearch,
    serverPort 8081,
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka
  }
  entities Blog, Post, Tag
}

application {
  config {
    baseName store,
    packageName com.okta.developer.store,
    applicationType microservice,
    authenticationType oauth2,
    databaseType mongodb,
    devDatabaseType mongodb,
    prodDatabaseType mongodb,
    enableHibernateCache false,
    searchEngine elasticsearch,
    serverPort 8082,
    serviceDiscoveryType eureka
  }
  entities Product
}

entity Blog {
  name String required minlength(3),
  handle String required minlength(2)
}

entity Post {
  title String required,
  content TextBlob required,
  date Instant required
}

entity Tag {
  name String required minlength(2)
}

entity Product {
  title String required,
  price BigDecimal required min(0),
  image ImageBlob
}

relationship ManyToOne {
  Blog{user(login)} to User,
  Post{blog(name)} to Blog
}

relationship ManyToMany {
  Post{tag(name)} to Tag{post}
}

paginate Post, Tag with infinite-scroll
paginate Product with pagination

microservice Product with store
microservice Blog, Post, Tag with blog
```

Run JHipster's `import-jdl` command to import this microservices architecture definition.

```bash
jhipster import-jdl apps.jh
```

The project generation process will take a minute or two, depending on your internet connection speed and hardware.

While you're waiting, you can get started with setting up OAuth with Okta.

### What is OAuth 2.0?

The OAuth implementation in JHipster leverages Spring Boot and its OAuth 2.0 support (an `@EnableOAuthSso` annotation). If you're not sure what OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are, please see [What the Heck is OAuth?](/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth). It provides single sign-on (SSO) to JHipster applications. [Secure a Spring Microservices Architecture with Spring Security and OAuth 2.0](/blog/2018/02/13/secure-spring-microservices-with-oauth) shows a bare-bones Spring microservices architecture using OAuth. JHipster uses the same setup internally.

JHipster ships with [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) configured for OAuth by default. To configure your apps to work with Okta, you'll first need to [create a free developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/). After doing so, you'll get your own Okta domain, which looks like `https://{yourOktaDomain}`.

{% img blog/microservices-jhipster-oauth/okta-signup.png alt:"Okta Developer Signup" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

### Create an OpenID Connect Application on Okta

Create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) app in Okta to get a client ID and secret. This basically means you're "registering" your application with Okta. Log in to your Okta Developer account and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Web** and click the **Next** . Give the app a name you'll remember (e.g., `JHipster Microservices`), and specify `http://localhost:8080` as a Base URI and `http://localhost:8080/login` as a Login Redirect URI. Click **Done** and make a note of your client ID and client secret values.

For the roles coming from Okta to match the default roles in JHipster, you'll need to create them. Create a `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER` group (**Users** > **Groups** > **Add Group**) and add users to them. You can use the account you signed up with, or create a new user (**Users** > **Add Person**). Navigate to **API** > **Authorization Servers**, click the **Authorization Servers** tab and edit the default one. Click the **Claims** tab and **Add Claim**. Name it `roles`, and include it in the ID Token. Set the value type to `Groups` and set the filter to be a Regex of `.*`.

Modify `gateway/src/main/resources/config/application.yml` to have the following values:

```yaml
security:
    oauth2:
        client:
            access-token-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token
            user-authorization-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize
            client-id: {clientId}
            client-secret: {clientSecret}
            scope: openid profile email
        resource:
            user-info-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo
```

You can also use environment variables to override the default values. Using this technique is recommend because 1) you don't need to modify the values in each microservice application and 2) it prevents you from leaking your client secret in a source code repository. Create `~/.okta.env` and copy the `export` commands below into it. With that file in place, you can run `source ~/.okta.env` to override the default Spring Security settings. 

```bash
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
```

If you want to make Okta settings the default, you can add `source ~/.okta.env` to `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`).

If you're hard-coding your Okta settings in `application.yml`, make sure you update your settings in the blog and store apps too. If you're using environment variable, you don't need to make any changes.

**TIP:** If you're using Protractor and want to run your tests against Okta, you'll need to add a user to the `ROLE_ADMIN` group on Okta and change the credentials to match that user in `src/test/javascript/e2e/account/account.spec.ts` and `src/test/javascript/e2e/admin/administration.spec.ts`.

## Start JHipster Registry and MongoDB

You'll need a service discovery server installed before you can start the gateway. You'll also need MongoDB for your store microservices. The blog application depends on Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL, but only when running in production mode. Luckily, JHipster creates Docker Compose files for all of the services your apps depend on. You can run the following commands from your project's root directory to start Docker containers for JHipster Registry and and MongoDB.

```bash
docker-compose -f gateway/src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d
docker-compose -f store/src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d
```

The aforementioned command will start the JHipster Registry with Keycloak for authentication. To use Okta, you'll need to modify `gateway/src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml` and change the default Keycloak settings to use your Okta settings, or environment variables (recommended).

```yaml
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI}
```

**TIP:** You can also put these variables in a file and specify an `env_file` setting. See [Environment variables in Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#the-env-file) to learn more.

Then you'll need to stop your JHipster Registry (if it's already running), and start it again.

```
docker-compose -f gateway/src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml down
docker-compose -f gateway/src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d
```

To login, you'll need to add `http://localhost:8761/login` as a Login redirect URI in your Okta app.

## Run Your Microservices Architecture

Open three terminal windows and navigate to each app (`gateway`, `blog`, and `store`). In each window, run Maven to start each app:

```
./mvnw
```

**TIP:** If you already have Maven installed, you can just use `mvn`.

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8761`. Log in, and you should see a welcome page that shows that the gateway, and both apps have been registered.

{% img blog/microservices-jhipster-oauth/jhipster-registry-with-gateway-apps.png alt:"JHipster Registry with Gateway  + Apps registered" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Once everything finishes starting, open a browser to `http://localhost:8080` and click **sign in**. You should be redirected to your Okta org to sign-in, then back to the gateway once you've entered valid credentials.

{% img blog/microservices-jhipster-oauth/welcome-jhipster.png alt:"Welcome, JHipster" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

{% img blog/microservices-jhipster-oauth/okta-sign-in.png alt:"Okta Sign-In" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

{% img blog/microservices-jhipster-oauth/jhipster-logged-in.png alt:"JHipster after Okta SSO" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

You should be able to navigate to **Entities** > **Blog** and add a new blog record to your blog microservice.

{% img blog/microservices-jhipster-oauth/new-blog.png alt:"New Blog" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Navigate to **Entities** > **Product** to prove your product microservice is working. Since you added an image as a property, you'll be prompted to upload one when creating a new record.

{% img blog/microservices-jhipster-oauth/add-product-page.png alt:"Add Product Page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click **Save** and you'll know it's correctly using MongoDB based on the generated ID.

{% img blog/microservices-jhipster-oauth/new-product.png alt:"New Product" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

### Use Docker Compose to Run Everything

Rather than starting all your services individually, you can also start them all using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

> If you'd like to learn more about Docker Compose, see [A Developer's Guide To Docker - Docker Compose](/blog/2017/10/11/developers-guide-to-docker-part-3).

Create a `docker-compose` directory in the parent directory of your applications and run JHipster's Docker Compose sub-generator.

```bash
mkdir docker-compose
cd docker-compose
jhipster docker-compose
```

Answer as follows when prompted:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Type of application? | `Microservice application` |
| Type of gateway? | `JHipster gateway` |
| Directory location? | `../` |
| Applications to include? | `<select all>`  |
| Applications with clustered databases? | `<blank>` |
| Setup monitoring? | `Yes, with JHipster Console` |
| Additional technologies? | `Zipkin` |
| Admin password | `<choose your own>` |

You'll get a warning saying you need to generate Docker images by running the following command in the `blog`, `gateway`, and `store` directories. Stop all your running processes and build your Docker images before proceeding.

```
./mvnw package -Pprod jib:dockerBuild
```

While you're waiting for things to build, edit `docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` and change the Spring Security settings from being hard-coded to being environment variables. Make this change for all applications.

```yaml
services:
    blog-app:
        image: blog
        environment:
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI}
    ...
    gateway-app:
        image: gateway
        environment:
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SCOPE=openid profile email
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI}
    ....
    store-app:
        image: store
        environment:
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI}        
```

You can remove Keycloak from `docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` since it won't be used with this configuration.

```yaml
keycloak:
    extends:
        file: keycloak.yml
        service: keycloak
```

You'll need to edit `docker-compose/jhipster-registry.yml` as well.

```yaml
services:
    jhipster-registry:
        ...
        environment:
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI}
```
            
**TIP:** You can run `docker-compose config` to verify the environment variables are correctly substituted.

When everything has finished building, run `docker-compose up -d` from the `docker-compose` directory. It can take a while to start all 14 containers, so now might be a good time to take a break, or go on a run. You can use Docker's Kitematic to watch the status of your images as they start.

**TIP:** Before you start everything, make sure you've provided adequate CPUs and memory to Docker. It defaults to one CPU and 2 GB of memory. Not quite enough for 14 containers!

{% img blog/microservices-jhipster-oauth/kitematic.png alt:"Kitematic" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

After you've verified everything works, you can stop all your Docker containers using the following command:

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
```

If you'd like to remove the images too, you can run:

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

## Deploy to Heroku

The founder of JHipster, [Julien Dubois](https://twitter.com/juliendubois), wrote a blog post on the Heroku blog titled [Bootstrapping Your Microservices Architecture with JHipster and Spring](https://blog.heroku.com/bootstrapping_your_microservices_architecture_with_jhipster_and_spring). Here's an abbreviated set of steps to deploy all your apps to Heroku.

### Deploy the JHipster Registry

Heroku and JHipster have configured a JHipster Registry for you, so you just need to click on the button below to start your own JHipster Registry:

<a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjhipster%2Fjhipster-registry"><img src="https://heroku-blog-files.s3.amazonaws.com/posts/1473343846-68747470733a2f2f7777772e6865726f6b7563646e2e636f6d2f6465706c6f792f627574746f6e2e706e67" alt="Deploy to Heroku"></a>

Enter an app name (I used `okta-jhipster-registry`), add a `JHIPSTER_PASSWORD`, and click **Deploy app**.

### Deploy Your Gateway and Apps to Heroku

In each project, run `jhipster heroku` and answer the questions as follows:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Name to deploy as? | `<unique-prefix>-<app-name>` (e.g., okta-gateway, okta-blog, etc.) |
| Which region? | `us` |
| Type of deployment? | `Git` |
| Name of Registry app? | `<unique-prefix>-jhipster-registry` |
| JHipster Registry username | `admin` |
| JHipster Registry password | `<JHIPSTER_PASSWORD from Registry>` |

When prompted to overwrite files, type `a`.

After each app has finished deploying, you'll want to run the following so they use Okta for authentication.

```bash
heroku config:set \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET"
```

Then update your Okta app to have a **Login redirect URI** that matches your Heroku app (e.g., `https://okta-gateway.herokuapp.com/`). To do this, log in to your Okta account, go to **Applications** > **JHipster Microservices** > **General** > **Edit**. 

To see if your apps have started correctly, you can run `heroku logs --tail` in each app's directory. You may see a timeout error, but your app should succeed in starting on its next attempt.

If it crashes and doesn't start, trying running `heroku restart`. If that doesn't solve the problem, go to <https://help.heroku.com> and click **Create a ticket** at the top. Click **Running Applications** > **Java**, scroll to the bottom, and click **Create a ticket**. Enter something like the following for the subject and description, select one of your apps, then submit it.

```
Subject: JHipster App Startup Timeout

Description: Hello, I have a JHipster (Spring Boot) app that has the following error on startup:

Error R10 (Boot timeout) -> Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 90 seconds of launch

The URLs is:

* https://<your-app>.herokuapp.com/

Can you please increase the timeout on this app?

Thanks!
```

Below are screenshots to prove everything worked after I deployed to Heroku. 😊

## Learn More about Microservices, OAuth 2.0, and JHipster

I hope you've enjoyed this whirlwind tour of how to create a microservices architecture with JHipster. Just because JHipster makes microservices easy doesn't mean you should use them. In the wise words of [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) (March 2014):

> "You shouldn't start with a microservices architecture. Instead begin with a monolith, keep it modular, and split it into microservices once the monolith becomes a problem."

Using a microservices architecture is a great way to scale development teams. However, if you don't have a large team, a [Majestic Monolith](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-29166d022228) might work better.
