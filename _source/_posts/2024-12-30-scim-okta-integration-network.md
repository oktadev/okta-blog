You have an app with SSO capabilities. What else can you do with Okta to transform it into an enterprise-ready powerhouse?

Today's enterprises face critical identity management challenges that directly impact their operations; this includes:

- Rapid business growth outpacing their current user management capabilities
- Scattered user accounts creating administrative chaos
- User management that doesn't scale with company growth (access free-for-all to resources)
- Bottlenecks in user provisioning slowing down productivity (i.e., manual provisioning)

and more critically, 

- Security vulnerabilities from inconsistent user deprovisioning

This is where you come in as a partner. By integrating with Okta through SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), a standard for managing users, you can offer enterprise customers a solution that addresses these pain points.

## Why System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is your gateway to enterprise success

It facilitates:
- Real-time user synchronization, which keeps customer organizations agile with instant updates as employees join, leave, or move within the company 
- Automated lifecycle management, which eliminates manual processes with streamlined provisioning, updates, and de-provisioning 
- Enhanced security controls, which give enterprises precise control over user access and permissions
- Standards-based integration, which leverages open Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols for reliable, interoperable, and consistent implementation
- Reduced operational complexity, which helps customers save on their identity management costs and overhead

## Accelerate your growth by joining the Okta Integration Network (OIN)
And once you have a SCIM-compliant integration with Okta, we invite you to [Okta's Integration Network (OIN)](https://www.okta.com/integrations/). Here, you can unlock potential growth by tapping into Okta's massive customer base of 18,000+ organizations, including leading companies and government institutions that rely on Okta as their identity security foundation. Furthermore, fast-track enterprise deals with your pre-built integration and reduces sales friction with verified enterprise-ready status. More importantly, you'll be able to differentiate your offering with premium security features.

## How to submit your SCIM integration to the Okta Integration Network (OIN)
Here is a video walkthrough on creating your SCIM provisioning instance for OIN testing and submission.

**Prerequisites**
- [Okta Integrator Free Plan](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)
- Runscope test links (2): [CRUD](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-oin-app/scim/main/#runscope-crud-tests) and [SPEC](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/scim-provisioning-integration-prepare/main/#test-your-scim-api) tests
- [Manual Okta SCIM integration tests](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-oin-app/scim/main/#manual-okta-scim-integration-tests)
- Provisioning-enabled instance and confirmation

Lastly, you must have a publicly accessible SCIM server for Okta to send requests to. I used the SCIM server from this [Enterprise Workshop on SCIM](/blog/2023/07/28/scim-workshop) to demo the submission process.
