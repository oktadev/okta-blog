In today's connected world, APIs are becoming an essential part of software and hardware companies. APIs allow companies to expose their services to third-party developers and integrate with other services. As more and more APIs are built and exposed to the internet, it is essential to secure them from unauthorized access. In this tutorial, you will learn how to build an [ASP.NET Core 3.1 Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-3.1) using GraphQL and secure it with Okta.

ASP.NET Core is an open-source framework for building web apps and web APIs. It is cross-platform, runs on [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction), and can be hosted on-premise or cloud-based.

To continue you will need:

- A basic knowledge of C#
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core)
- An [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/) (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs)

## Benefits of GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an open-source technology developed by Facebook that allows API developers to create a type system for the data—allowing clients to write queries against these types—and a server-side runtime for executing these queries. GraphQL allows you to query exactly the fields you need, so you can avoid fetching extra data that you don't need. It also is strongly typed so it validates all your queries before running them. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific web framework or database engine and can be used with any technology that supports it.

## Create an ASP.NET Core API with GraphQL

Let's build an API for time tracking. Fire up Visual Studio and create a new project by clicking **File>New Project** select **ASP.NET Core Web Application**, and click **Next**. Name the app *TimeGraphServer* and click **Create**. On the next window, select **Empty** and click **OK**.

{% img blog/csharp-graphql/01-image.png alt:"GraphQL C#" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Alternatively, you can create the project by running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
dotnet new web
```

## Create Data Model and Set Up Database

For the demo of this article, I'll use an in-memory database provider for Entity Framework Core. I'll install the latest version of `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory` NuGet package (3.1.7 as of publish date of this post). You can also install it from NuGet Package Manager or by running the following command:

```sh
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory --version 3.1.7
```

In the `TimeGraphServer` project create a folder called `Models` and add `Project.cs` and `TimeLog.cs` classes:

```cs
public class Project
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string CreatedBy { get; set; }
}
```

```cs
public class TimeLog
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public DateTime From { get; set; }
  public DateTime To { get; set; }

  public string User { get; set; }

  public int ProjectId { get; set; }
  public Project Project { get; set; }
}
```

Next, you will need to set up a database context for Entity Framework Core. Create another folder called `Database` and add `TimeGraphContext` class:

```cs
public class TimeGraphContext : DbContext
{
  public TimeGraphContext(DbContextOptions<TimeGraphContext> options) : base(options)
  {
  }

  public DbSet<Project> Projects { get; set; }
  public DbSet<TimeLog> TimeLogs { get; set; }
}

```

Now that we have the `TimeGraphContext`, let's add it to the available services. Open the `Startup.cs` file and paste the following in `ConfigureServices` method:

```cs
services.AddDbContext<TimeGraphContext>(context =>
{
  context.UseInMemoryDatabase("TimeGraphServer");
});
```

You have now configured Entity Framework Core to use an in-memory database called `TimeGraphServer`. The in-memory database is mainly used for tests, but it will be enough for the purposes of this tutorial.

Now let's populate the database with some dummy data. In the `TimeGraphContext` class, override the `OnModelCreating` method and replace it with the following:

```cs
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
  modelBuilder.Entity<Project>().HasData(new Project
  {
      CreatedBy = "Giorgi",
      Id = 1,
      Name = "Migrate to TLS 1.2"
  }, new Project
  {
      CreatedBy = "Giorgi",
      Id = 2,
      Name = "Move Blog to Hugo"
  });

  modelBuilder.Entity<TimeLog>().HasData(new TimeLog
  {
      Id = 1,
      From = new DateTime(2020, 7, 24, 12, 0, 0),
      To = new DateTime(2020, 7, 24, 14, 0, 0),
      ProjectId = 1,
      User = "Giorgi"
  }, new TimeLog
  {
      Id = 2,
      From = new DateTime(2020, 7, 24, 16, 0, 0),
      To = new DateTime(2020, 7, 24, 18, 0, 0),
      ProjectId = 1,
      User = "Giorgi"
  }, new TimeLog
  {
      Id = 3,
      From = new DateTime(2020, 7, 24, 20, 0, 0),
      To = new DateTime(2020, 7, 24, 22, 0, 0),
      ProjectId = 2,
      User = "Giorgi"
  });
}
```

To force Entity Framework Core to create the database containing the seed data, add `Database.EnsureCreated();` to the constructor of the `TimeGraphContext` class.

Our database set up is now complete so you are now ready to add GraphQL support to the project.

## Configure GraphQL in Your API

To add GraphQL support I will use the [HotChocolate](https://hotchocolate.io/) library. HotChocolate is a set of libraries that provide GraphQL implementation for .NET Core and .NET Classic.

First, install the following packages:

```sh
dotnet add package HotChocolate.AspNetCore
dotnet add package HotChocolate.AspNetCore.Playground
```

Next, go to the `Startup` class and replace the `Configure` method with this:

```cs
if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
  app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
  app.UsePlayground(new PlaygroundOptions
  {
      QueryPath = "/api",
      Path = "/playground"
  });
}

app.UseGraphQL("/api");
```

This will configure GraphQL server to be available at the `/api` endpoint and, when running in development mode, we will have a nice simple GraphQL ide available at `/playground` which we will see in action in a minute.

Next, I will expose our types to GraphQL for querying.

## Add Queries to GraphQL

For each type that you want to expose through GraphQL, you need to create a corresponding GraphQL type. Add a folder called `GraphQL` to the project and create `GraphQLTypes.cs` like this:

```cs
public class ProjectType : ObjectType<Project>
{
}

public class TimeLogType : ObjectType<TimeLog>
{
}
```

Next, add `Query.cs` and paste the following:

```cs
public class Query
{
  private readonly TimeGraphContext dbContext;

  public Query(TimeGraphContext dbContext)
  {
      this.dbContext = dbContext;
  }

  public IQueryable<Project> Projects => dbContext.Projects;
  public IQueryable<TimeLog> TimeLogs => dbContext.TimeLogs;
}
```

The `Query` class is the root type that the GraphQL server will expose—it will allow clients to query `Project` and `TimeLog` entities. Go to the `ConfigureServices` method in the `Startup` class and add the following:

```cs
services.AddGraphQL(provider => SchemaBuilder.New().AddServices(provider)
    .AddType<ProjectType>()
    .AddType<TimeLogType>()
    .AddQueryType<Query>()
    .Create());
```

This will add the `Query` type as a root query type and register a GraphQL schema with the dependency injection container.

This completes the definition of our GraphQL queries so let's run the project now and see what our GraphQL API looks like!

## Execute Queries from GraphQL Playground

Hit the F5 button and you will see GraphQL playground which looks like this:

{% img blog/csharp-graphql/02-image.png alt:"GraphQL C#" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

If you click the **Schema** button at the right of the screen you will see the raw contents of our GraphQL API schema:

{% img blog/csharp-graphql/03-image.png alt:"GraphQL C#" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click the **Docs** button and you will see a human-readable version of the schema:

{% img blog/csharp-graphql/04-image.png alt:"GraphQL C#" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Now, paste the following query in the left panel and click the **Play** button:

```javascript
{
  projects{
      id
      createdBy
      name
  }
}
```

Our GraphQL API will execute the query, and you will see the results in the right panel:

{% img blog/csharp-graphql/05-image.png alt:"GraphQL C#" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, it's time to secure the API!

## Secure GraphQL API with Okta

In this tutorial, I will use Okta to easily secure the API, so that I don't have to roll my own identity provider and deal with all the tricky details. Okta supports user authentication, multi-factor authentication, social authentication, as well as all OpenID connect flows out of the box—so it can take care of all the scenarios you might ever need.

To get started, log in to your [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/)—via the URL emailed to you after signing up—to access your org's portal dashboard. Once you log in, make sure to note your Org URL from the upper right corner of the screen:

{% img blog/csharp-graphql/06-image.png alt:"GraphQL C#" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Now, create a new application. Click **Applications** in the top menu and then **Add Application**. Select **Native** and click **Service**.

{% img blog/csharp-graphql/07-image.png alt:"GraphQL C#" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Enter a name (I will use TimeGraphClient), and click **Done**. On the next screen, you will see `Client Id` and `Client Secret` of the application. You will need these to call the API, so take note of them.

{% img blog/csharp-graphql/08-image.png alt:"GraphQL C#" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, go back to Visual Studio and add `Okta.AspNetCore` and `HotChocolate.AspNetCore.Authorization` NuGet packages:

```sh
dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore
dotnet add package HotChocolate.AspNetCore.Authorization
```

## Configure Okta middleware

Go the `Startup` class and add this using statement:

```cs
using Okta.AspNetCore;
```

Next, add the following code in the `ConfigureServices` method and add your Okta configuration:

```cs
services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
  options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
  options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
  options.DefaultSignInScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddOktaWebApi(new OktaWebApiOptions()
{
  OktaDomain = "https://${yourOktaDomain}"
});
```

Then, in the Configure method, add this line above the `UseGraphQL` line:

```cs
app.UseAuthentication();
```

## Add Authorization to HotChocolate

Now that you have configured authentication for the service, you need to secure the actual GraphQL objects. In this tutorial, I will allow unauthorized users to query `Projects` but require authentication for `TimeLogs.`

To achieve this override, `Configure` method in `TimeLogType` class:

```cs
  protected override void Configure(IObjectTypeDescriptor<TimeLog> descriptor)
  {
      descriptor.Authorize();
  }
```

Finally, go to the `ConfigureServices` method and register authorize directive in the `AddGraphQL` method:

```cs
services.AddGraphQL(provider => SchemaBuilder.New().AddServices(provider)
    .AddType<ProjectType>()
    .AddType<TimeLogType>()
    .AddAuthorizeDirectiveType()
    .AddQueryType<Query>()
    .Create());
```

## Test Your Secure GraphQL API

If you run the project again and execute the same query as above, you will get the same results as the previous time. But, if you run the query for all the `TimeLog` entries, you will get *The current user is not authorized to access this resource* error:

```javascript
{
  timeLogs{
      id
      from
      to
  }
}
```

{% img blog/csharp-graphql/09-image.png alt:"GraphQL C#" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

To access the protected items, you need to make a call to your authenticator so that you receive a token. In your Okta developer console, go to **API** and click **Authorization Servers**. Note the *Issuer URI* as you will need it to make the request to get a token. Finally, click on the name of the server, click on the **Scopes** tab, and add a new scope called `api_access`.

{% img blog/csharp-graphql/10-image.png alt:"GraphQL C#" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

You are now ready to request a token from your authorization server. To make the request I will use Postman but you are free to use any other REST client that you prefer. The token endpoint is located at `/v1/token`, so I will make a request to `https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token` URL. You will also need to pass the `client_id` and `client_secret` parameters of your client application. Issue the request and you will get an `access_token` back from your authorization server:

{% img blog/csharp-graphql/11-image.png alt:"GraphQL C#" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Now that you have `access_token`, go back to the playground, click on the **HTTP HEADERS** panel and pass your token in `Authorization` header like this:

```js
{
  "Authorization":"Bearer <your token here>"
}
```

Click the **Play** button and this time you will get the list of `TimeLog` entries:

{% img blog/csharp-graphql/12-image.png alt:"GraphQL C#" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Now you have a secure GraphQL API!
