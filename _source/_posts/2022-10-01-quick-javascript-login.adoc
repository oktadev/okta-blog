Hello,

My name is Matt Raible, and I am a developer advocate at Okta. I've worked here for over five years; before that, I was an independent consultant for 20 years, mainly doing Java and web development for clients.

I've learned a lot about OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Okta's SDKs over my Okta years and only recently tried to use Auth0's. Over the last couple of weeks, I integrated many Auth0 SDKs into OktaDev Schematics.

I was pleasantly surprised by the experience because the configuration often boils down to two values: `domain` and `clientId`. And then, it just works! There's no need to worry about issuers, redirect URIs, or callback URLs.

This is a strong departure from how we've done things in Okta's SDKs, where we expect people to know about OpenID Connect. We often try to educate developers about OAuth and OIDC but since these topics are complex, they can be challenging to understand. I like the approach of just needing two values, and everything just works!

== What is OktaDev Schematics?

https://github.com/oktadev/schematics[OktaDev Schematics] is a tool I developed to help streamline integrating OIDC authentication into JavaScript (or TypeScript) applications. In my first few years at Okta, I'd demo how to use our Angular SDK at conferences, and I'd inevitably miss a step, causing the demo to fail.

A failing demo is frustrating, so I created OktaDev Schematics to fix it. My idea was simple:

1. Create an app using the framework's CLI
2. Integrate OIDC authentication using templates
3. Add a unit test to prove nothing breaks

The project builds on https://angular.io/guide/schematics[Angular Schematics], so it's incredibly easy to use in Angular projects.

[source,shell]
----
ng add @oktadev/schematics
----

This command will prompt you for an issuer and client ID, and then OktaDev Schematics will configure your app to use them. If you're using the https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli[Auth0 CLI], you'll need to create a Single-Page Application (SPA) app to get these values.

[source,shell]
----
auth0 apps create
----

In the latest release, I've made it so that adding an `--auth0` flag will set up your project to use Auth0 instead of Okta.

If you're using Angular or Ionic with Angular, you can create an app and then add OIDC authentication in just two commands!

- Angular: `ng new` and `ng add @oktadev/schematics --auth0`
- Ionic: `ionic start` and `ng add @oktadev/schematics --auth0`

The tool is smart enough to detect the framework you're using and if you're using TypeScript or JavaScript.

If you want to create a React app, you'll need to perform a few steps:

1. Create your React app with Create React App:

  npx create-react-app secure-app
+
TIP: Add `--template typescript` if you want TypeScript support.

2. Install the Schematics CLI globally:

  npm i -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli

3. In the `secure-app` project, install OktaDev Schematics and run the `add-auth` schematic:

  npm i -D @oktadev/schematics
  schematics @oktadev/schematics:add-auth

As you can guess, the integration is pretty bare-bones. It configures the SDK and adds a login/logout button. I believe this is in line with the apps each CLI generates. They're pretty bare-bones too!

If you'd like to see how to add user information to an Angular app, please read my https://auth0.com/blog/add-oidc-to-angular-apps-quickly/[Add OpenID Connect to Angular Apps Quickly] tutorial.

If you'd like to see how the templates differ between Okta and Auth0, you can https://github.com/oktadev/schematics/tree/main/src/add-auth[view the templates on GitHub]. If you have a GitHub account, you can also https://github.dev/oktadev/schematics[launch github.dev/oktadev/schematics] and navigate to `src/add-auth/{auth0,okta}`.

== JavaScript Framework Support

There's a wealth of popular frameworks currently supported by OktaDev Schematics:

- https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#angular[Angular]
- https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#react[React]
- https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#vue[Vue]
- https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#ionic[Ionic with Angular]
- https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#react-native[React Native]
- https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#express[Express]

See the project's https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#links[links section] if you want to learn more about Okta or Auth0's SDKs.

The support for Ionic currently only includes Angular. However, Ionic does support React and Vue too. To make OIDC authentication work, I leveraged https://github.com/wi3land/ionic-appauth[Ionic AppAuth]. One cool thing about this library is it has https://github.com/wi3land/ionic-appauth/tree/master/demos/react[React] and https://github.com/wi3land/ionic-appauth/tree/master/demos/vue[Vue] examples available. I recently updated these to work with Capacitor 4.

== The Beauty of Continuous Integration

As part of creating this library, I wrote many tests, including integration tests that:
Create an app with a CLI
Integrate Okta/Auth0 SDKs
Run tests to ensure nothing breaks

These commands are all encapsulated in a https://github.com/oktadev/schematics/blob/main/test-app.sh[`test-app.sh` script] I wrote. It's kinda ugly and can probably be improved, but it works pretty well for now.

If nothing else, this script shows you how to automate creating apps with framework CLIs for continuous integration. The project's https://github.com/oktadev/schematics/blob/main/.github/workflows/apps.yml[Apps workflow] shows how all these frameworks are tested in a matrix.

You might notice that all the CLIs are installed without a version number:

[source,yaml]
----
run: npm i -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli @angular/cli @vue/cli @ionic/cli
----

This is done on purpose, so these templates are continuously tested against the latest release. There's a https://github.com/oktadev/schematics/blob/main/.github/workflows/nightly.yml[Nightly worflow] that ensures nothing breaks every evening. Dependabot is also https://github.com/oktadev/schematics/blob/main/.github/dependabot.yml[configured] to keep the project's dependencies and SDK versions up-to-date.

== Learn more about Authentication in JavaScript

Creating and maintaining OktaDev Schematics has greatly benefited me and my knowledge of Okta and Auth0's SDKs. I sometimes find issues with new major releases of frameworks and our SDKs. Since the CLIs always use the latest versions, I often find problems before anyone else. Ahhh, the beauty of testing automation! ðŸ˜ƒ
