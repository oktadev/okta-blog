Back in the days of [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS), software developers couldn't count much on fancy tools. There were no graphical interfaces, and everything was purely text-based. I remember using [brief](http://www.briefeditor.com/index.htm) as an editor for my C source files (C++ didn't exist yet), and compiling the code from the command line with the [Aztec C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_C) compiler. The most advanced concept of a non-trivial software project was based on [makefiles](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile). The idea of grabbing a mouse and moving it around the desk to operate a computer would have been hilarious (or disgusting maybe!). No clicks or taps, only keystrokes - and a lot of them.

With the appearance of the graphical OSs, and point-and-click devices, we grew bored of hitting keys; it annoys us when there is no reason to click or tap, and we are forced to go back to the keyboard. The annoyance escalates sometimes to anger if there is not a shortcut or a copy-and-paste solution and we have to write down the full command, character-by-character!

While graphical interfaces are very convenient and user-friendly, they are not ideal with repetitive sequences of operations. Modern [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) aims to make faster infrastructure configuration and application deployment. The availability of a tooling system that allows scripting these operations on automated and streamlined workflows is paramount to achieve better performances.

### Command-Line? Discover Why

With .NET Core and Azure Microsoft aiming to gain a bigger share in the software development industry, non-Windows operating system's ban policy adopted in the past by the Redmond giant gave way to a new era where different mainstream operating systems and devices (like Linux, macOS, iOS and Android) are embraced as allied, instead of fought against as competitors in the software business.

In addition to the graphical-first approach that characterized .NET Framework, .NET Core and Azure offer complete command-line-oriented tooling, including a built-in Linux integration ([WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), Windows Subsystem for Linux).

In this tutorial I am going to demonstrate how you can create and deploy to the Cloud an application including Okta Security services using the .NET Core and the Azure command-line interface tools, respectively known as **dotnet** and **az**.

### Requirements

The resources used for this post are:

- A computer with a .NET Core compatible Operating System (I used Windows 10)
- A modern internet browser (I used Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge)
- An [Azure account](https://portal.azure.com) (Free Tier is ok)
- An [Okta Development account](https://developer.okta.com/)
- Your favorite text editor (I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- [ASP.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (I am using version 3.1.401)
- The Azure Command Line Interface ([Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)) tool

## Prep an ASP.NET Core Application for the Azure CLI

In this paragraph you will create a new ASP.NET Core application using **dotnet** and add the Okta security layer with a **text editor**.

Create a basic ASP.NET Core MVC application, using the dotnet CLI and the mvc template and Check that it works as expected.

```powershell
dotnet new mvc -n okta-cli-app
```

Then run the application.

```powershell
dotnet run
```

The output should look like the following:

{% img blog/10x-azure-cli/image1.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

The application is now served at the two addresses indicated in the log messages; open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should get the following page:

{% img blog/10x-azure-cli/image2.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

> Note that the browser has been redirected to the URL `https://localhost:5001`. This is because the standard template includes by default a redirection to to the secure protocol (**`app.UseHttpsRedirection()`** is called by **`Configure()`** in **`Startup.cs`**)

You are now ready to add the authentication and authorization features: [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/), of course! Stop the running app by pressing CTRL+C in the terminal.

To make the necessary code changes, a simple text editor would be enough. In this case, I am using Visual Studio Code.

Add the **`Okta.AspNetCore`** package to the project.

```powershell
dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore
```

{% img blog/10x-azure-cli/image3.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

This modifies the project file *okta-cli-app.cspro*, adding an entry for the dependency.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Okta.AspNetCore" Version="3.3.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Modify **`Startup.cs`** as follows

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Okta.AspNetCore;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace okta_cli_app
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddAuthentication(options =>
            {
                options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
            })
           .AddCookie()
           .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
           {
                // Replace these values with your Okta configuration
                OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue<string>("Okta:OktaDomain"),
               ClientId = Configuration.GetValue<string>("Okta:ClientId"),
               ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue<string>("Okta:ClientSecret"),
               Scope = new List<string> { "openid", "profile", "email" },
           });

            services.AddControllersWithViews();
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            else
            {
                app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
                app.UseHsts();
            }
            app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            app.UseStaticFiles();

            app.UseRouting();

            app.UseAuthentication();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
            {
                endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                    name: "default",
                    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
            });
        }
    }
}
```

Now the application is fully equipped with the Okta middleware to manage Authentication and Authorization. However, there isn't any part of the application using it, yet.

Whenever you put an *Authorize* attribute declaration on a Controller or Action, The ASP.NET Core runtime verifies that a user is logged in and has been granted the necessary authority. If not, you are redirected to the Okta login page.

In this case, we are going to implement an explicit Sign In/Sign Out feature, with two links in the top bar of the front-end User Interface.

Add **`AccountControllers.cs`** to the project, under the Controllers folder.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace okta_cli_app.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult SignIn()
        {
            if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult SignOut()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(
                new[]
                {
                     OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                     CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
                },
                new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/Home/" });
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, the new controller provides the two actions, one for *Signing In* and one for *Signing Out*.

Finally, add two links to the top bar of the UI, with the following razor code in **`_Layout.cshtml`**.

```html
<div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex flex-sm-row-reverse">
    @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
            <li><p class="navbar-text">Hello, @User.Identity.Name</p></li>
            <li><a class="nav-link" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Profile" id="profile-button">Profile</a></li>
            <li>
                <form class="form-inline" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignOut" method="post">
                    <button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark" id="logout-button">Sign Out</button>
                </form>
            </li>
        </ul>
    }
    else
    {
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
            <li><a asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignIn" id="login-button">Sign In</a></li>
        </ul>
    }
    <ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1">  
```

## Set Up Your Okta Application for Azure

The application is now ready to provide its services, enriched with a state-of-the-art security framework, in conjunction with a first-class Cloud-based authentication/authorization provider as Okta. You have probably realized that something is missing: I have done nothing (yet) to inform the provider that my brand new application, **okta-cli-app**, is going to ask it to manage authentication and authorization matters on its behalf.
To fix this I need to set up a proper configuration in Okta and bind my ASP.NET Core project to it.

If you haven't yet got an Okta developer account, please [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/) and grab one, it's quick and free. You will need one to perform the next step.

Login to your Okta developer account and create a new application.

{% img blog/10x-azure-cli/image4.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

This is how it looks after I have filled all the necessary fields:

{% img blog/10x-azure-cli/image5.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

> Note that the TCP port 5001 must be the same used by the application. You can see it in the messages displayed in the terminal when you start the application with **`dotnet run`**.

At the bottom of the page, you see two fields containing cryptic strings, named ***Client ID*** and ***Client secret***.

{% img blog/10x-azure-cli/image6.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

A third fundamental value you need to complete the configuration process is the Okta domain URL, which has been created for you when you signed up for your new account. You can find it on the top-right of the dashboard page.

{% img blog/10x-azure-cli/image7.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Insert these three values in the **appsettings.json** file in the ASP.NET Core project:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Okta": {
    "OktaDomain": "https://dev-509249.okta.com",
    "ClientId": "0oaq5vf8fzPfAljzy4x6",
    "ClientSecret": "HoGyxgDTrMfNqDp4RO234CEQxDAwuXnZm2FycON-"
  }  
}

```

Go back to the terminal and start it again.

```sh
dotnet run
```

Point your browser to `http://localhost:5000` once again and you should see the same page as before but with a Sign In link on the left of the top bar.

{% img blog/10x-azure-cli/image8.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

You can now click on Sign In and get redirected to the Okta login page. Once logged in, you'll see the top bar changing.

{% img blog/10x-azure-cli/image9.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

> Even though this post is about using the command line tooling rather than the IDE's plugins or the portal user experience, I haven't done so when creating the Okta application. It's worth mentioning here that Okta services are offered through the portal, a Web API interface and an SDK (Okta.Sdk) - but the new [Okta CLI](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-cli) tool has just been released! This allows DevOps engineers to fully automate the Okta account and application setting management and integrate Okta configurations in the CI/CD pipelines.

## The Azure CLI Cloud Deployment Process

Microsoft Azure allows us to setup and configure everything right from the Azure Portal. While this is very convenient while learning, it's not ideal when the same sequences of operations need to be repeated. Modern DevOps aim to make faster infrastructure configuration and application deployment. The availability of a tooling system that allows you to script these operations on automated and streamlined workflows is necessary in order to achieve better performance. I am now going to demonstrate how you can deploy the application we just created to Azure, using the Azure Command Line Interface (Azure CLI, a.k.a **az**).

```powershell
az login
```

This command opens a browser page where you are requested to login to your Microsoft account. This means, of course, that to proceed with the following steps you need to have an Azure account and a valid (even free-tier) subscription.
Once logged in (you only need to do this once), you can begin creating resources.

Create a Resource Group:

```powershell
az group create -n okta-cli-rg
```

{% img blog/10x-azure-cli/image10.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Create an Application Service Plan:

```powershell
az appservice plan create -n okta-cli-plan --resource-group okta-cli-rg --sku FREE
```

{% img blog/10x-azure-cli/image11.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Create the Application Service Instance:

```powershell
az webapp create -g okta-cli-rg -p okta-cli-plan -n okta-cli-app
```

{% img blog/10x-azure-cli/image12.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Your application is now deployed to the Cloud and available to the world at the address `https://okta-cli-app.azurewebsites.net/`. But before trying it, don't forget that you need to align the URLs in your Okta application to the new address. You do that simply replacing the Okta application page, the old `http://localhost:5000` with the new  `https://okta-cli-app.azurewebsites.net/` in all the fields that contain it (should be three).

You can now open the browser and surf to `https://okta-cli-app.azurewebsites.net/`. Or, if you prefer, automate this step as well with another console command.

```powershell
az webapp browse -n okta-cli-app
```

That's all there is to it!

## Recap

In this article, I explored the basics of two command-line interface utilities (ASP.NET Core CLI and Azure CLI) and showed how to use them to create, build and deploy to the Cloud a web application, without using an IDE or a web portal.

What you learned:

- Create an ASP.NET Core web application with **dotnet new**
- Add Okta ASP.NET Core package to the application with **dotnet add**
- Implement a basic Sign In/Sign Out workflow using **Okta**
- Build and run the application with **dotnet run**
- Login the local Azure CLI to your Azure account with **az login**
- Create an Azure resource group with **az group create**
- Create an Azure application service plan with **az appservice plan create**
- Create an Azure application service instance with **az webapp create**
- Launch the browser and point it to an Azure application using **az webapp browse**
