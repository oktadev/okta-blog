When you've built a successful software-as-a-service product, you tend to run
into interesting technical (and business) questions. My favorite question is:
"How do we add more functionality to our platform faster?" It's an interesting
question because *everyone* wants to build features faster.

In a perfect world, you'd be able to hire 100,000 engineers, split them into
teams of four (*with no managers!*), and have each team own a feature: spec it
out, build it, iterate on it with user feedback, and do it all in perfect
harmony with every other team.

But let's get real. This isn't a perfect world, there's no way a company would
ever have four engineers work in a team without management (*ha*)!

So while you may not be able to build features at a fast enough pace to keep up
with your product and user growth, you can cheat your way around it with a
popular hack: platform extensibility.

Instead of requiring your engineers to sit down and develop every single feature
every single user has ever requested, you can turn your product into a
"platform" that your customer's developers can build against. This way, if a
customer wants a feature badly enough, they can integrate with your platform
APIs and BAM: the previously unavailable feature can now be made available! It's
ingenious.

So how do you (as a successful business owner) allow other developers to extend
your platform? You've got a lot of choices. Most of them are horrible, however,
so I'm only going to talk about the most popular two: webhooks and serverless.


## Serverless is the Answer!

If you've been following the internet hype train over the last few years
(*specifically, since 2014*), you'll be familiar with the term "serverless",
also known as "lambdas", "functions-as-a-service", etc.

What all these terms basically refer to is a pattern known as *serverless
extensibility*.

In order to accommodate your customers extending your platform, you allow them
to upload some code to your servers that *you* will run when certain events
happen in your product.

I'll give you a good example.

Let's say you're building an application hosting platform (*a-la
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)*). Heroku provides functionality like running
your application code, logging errors, and provisioning infrastructure
(databases, etc.).

If a customer is using your platform and wants to send an email to their
accounting team every time a new database is provisioned, this can be somewhat
tricky unless your platform provides either a feature to do this, or
extensibility options so the customer can do it on their own.

So, you decide to allow serverless extensibility. A customer can now upload some
code (in JavaScript) to run on your platform every time a new piece of
infrastructure is provisioned.

The customer reads through your docs, and writes a small function that looks
something like this:

```javascript
module.exports = sendEmail(event) {
  if (event.type === "provision" && event.service === "database") {
    // some code to send an email to the accounting department
  }
}
```

And then uploads it to your website.

This is pretty cool for the customer! Without needing to bug you and wait for
your engineering team to build this email feature out, they were able to write
some code to accomplish exactly what they wanted!

And not only can customers "hook" into your platform when infrastructure is
being provisioned: they can hook in anywhere! Your platform provides tons of
different extensibility options to make it possible for customers to run their
code after or before almost every major platform event!

There are a few core benefits to this:

- The customer can easily build out features they need, and not be bottlenecked by
  the speed of your engineering team
- You lose fewer customers because they've now got a way to work around issues in
  your product
- You're able to iterate more quickly on your core platform product because you're
  now able to narrow your scope


## The Flip Side of Serverless

So now that you've built out serverless extensibility functionality for your
customers you've opened up an infinite amount of customization options. But at
what cost?

John, who runs Engineering for one of your largest customers, didn't sign up for
this. Your serverless extensibility created a bunch of ongoing work for him and
his team:

- He has to figure out how your serverless functions work, what hooks are
  available, etc. This is a high learning curve and requires all of his
  engineers to have a thorough understanding of your product in order to be
  productive.
- Because your serverless platform only supports running JavaScript ES5 code at
  the moment, John's team of C# engineers are having issues writing their
  complex application logic in JavaScript which they are not all familiar with.
- John's team doesn't have any insight into how your serverless platform is
  running his code: they can't figure out how to monitor server resources, how
  to do proper unit and integration testing, how to look for failures, etc.
- John's team now has to manage code in many different places as opposed to just
  one GitHub repository. Now, each serverless function John's team writes must
  be manually uploaded into the right place in your platform website,
  maintained, and updated from time to time. Because there is no direct way to
  integrate these serverless functions into the team's existing codebase, this
  code is now fragmented across your platform which makes it hard to work with.
- John's team is now in a sticky security situation: they've got to write
  proprietary code and store it on YOUR platform. They've also got to store
  sensitive credentials like their email account information, and any other
  related credentials required to run their serverless software. The security
  team at John's company isn't thrilled.

The larger the company, the more challenging this becomes. Coordinating between
different groups of engineers to figure out where a particular piece of
functionality is located is difficult and time-consuming. Updating previous
hooks becomes a test of patience. And documentation for the team's codebase
becomes exponentially larger to include all of the domain-specific knowledge
required to write, update, and maintain these serverless hooks.

These side effects negate the purpose of the original goal: to let customers get
functionality they need faster.

And these are just the *customer facing* side effects you'll notice. There's a
vast array of other messes this will cause you and your company:

- You've got to build secure, isolated code execution environments to run
  customer code in a sandbox. This is incredibly hard in practice. If you search
  for "[docker escalation](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=docker+escalation)" on Google,
  you'll see what I mean. Even amazing services like Amazon Lambda (the
  first really serverless player) that have incredibly large security teams
  can expose themselves to funny [security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ058hmLuv0)
  issues.
- You've got to ensure you respect the customer's software IP that is now
  running in your infrastructure
- You've got to scale your infrastructure to support arbitrary amounts of
  customer code in addition to worrying about your own service issues
- You've got to expose more and more transparent tools to allow your customers
  more insight into your system: error logs, performance monitoring, etc. The
  list can ultimately go on forever.
- You've got to write documentation to explain each and every hook you support
  and how it works. You've also got to show users how to upload the code to your
  platform, how to test it, etc.

Bottom line? Building serverless extensibility functionality into your product
will likely be the most expensive thing you ever do, engineering-wise--both for
you and your users.


## Webhooks, Going Beyond Serverless Extensibility

An older approach that's been tested time and time again, is webhooks. While
webhooks are not "old" by any means, they predate serverless extensibility
patterns by at least seven years. My buddy [Jeff Lindsay](http://progrium.com/blog/)
coined the term back in 2007.

The idea behind webhooks is simple: instead of *you* running a customer's code
on *your platform*, you instead just fire off an HTTP POST request to the
customer every time something happens, and the customer can then perform
whatever logic they need based on those incoming requests.

Simple, right?

This is a great approach because it's easier to manage and scale for all parties
involved.

It's simpler for *your* company because you now only need to fire off HTTP
requests when events happen. You don't need to worry about executing someone
else's software, scaling it, etc. The most complicated thing you have to do is
retry failed HTTP requests (which is mandatory for pretty much all HTTP requests
anyhow!).

It's simpler for your customers because they don't need to learn anything new
(other than reading your docs to find out what requests you make, and what data
you send).

Customers can simply implement backend logic in their already existing
application in whatever language/framework/etc. they prefer. The customer
doesn't need to learn a new tech stack, new deployment patterns, and doesn't
need to figure out how to create a bunch of small, independent programs that are
scattered all over the place.

Webhooks allow customers to extend your platform in a simpler,
easier-to-understand way.


## Webhooks in the Wild


### Twilio

[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) is one of the best known API services in the
world. Twilio provides API services to manage telephony stuff: phone calls, SMS
messages, MMS messages, etc.

Since day one, Twilio has provided core webhook support in their platform.

Let's say you're building an SMS application:

- You buy a phone number through Twilio
- Every time that phone number receives an SMS message, Twilio sends an HTTP
  POST request to your web server with the message data inside
- You then receive an HTTP POST request to your web app, where you parse the
  request, figure out what the message said, and then take some action (*maybe
  you send a response, for instance*)

Using this simple back-and-forth messaging pattern, webhooks allow Twilio
customers to easily integrate with the platform and build high-value apps
without the hassle.

**NOTE**: My good friend [Carter Rabasa](http://carter.rabasa.com/) at Twilio
recently released support for serverless extensibility *in addition to* their
core webhook support. This was a smart move, as they now appeal to everyone
(*even people who crazily prefer serverless extensibility patterns!*).


### Heroku

Remember Heroku from the serverless example before? I hope so!

Heroku's application hosting platform recently started [supporting
webhooks](https://blog.heroku.com/heroku-webhooks), and it's everything I ever
dreamed of, and then some!

Heroku customers are now able to easily hook into their app infrastructure on
Heroku, and perform complex logic to scale their services more easily, cut down
cost, keep their ops team informed of issues, etc.


### GitHub

[GitHub webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) have been around
forever, and are the foundation of many popular developer services like
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).

GitHub webhooks allow you to hook into just about every possible action that can
be taken on a source repository. They're excellent for analyzing code, tracking
team performance, automating testing and deploys, as well as a number of other
great use cases.


## Webhooks in Your Product

Implementing serverless extensibility is hard–both for you and your customers.
While there are some people who prefer it, it can be a lot of work for everyone
involved.

As someone who's been building developer tools and API services for nearly 17
years now, one of which generates nearly 30 billion API requests per month, I'd
encourage you to take some time to think about the best possible way for you to
open your platform up for customization.

Picking the wrong extensibility options can be a painful mistake, so it's a good
idea to think through the tradeoffs of both approaches, and pick what makes the
most sense for you.

[tweet at me](https://twitter.com/rdegges), I'd be happy to help you out.


## Summary

While both serverless extensibility and webhooks serve the same purpose, one is
dramatically simpler than the other.

Webhooks are a simple solution to a complex problem, while serverless
extensibility is a complex solution to a complex problem.

In computer science, as well as many other areas of professional and personal
life, I like to take the simple path.

I hope this has been useful.
