OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 are already recognized as a powerful way to incorporate authentication and authorization into modern web applications.

Okta has enhanced the capabilities of these standards by introducing its Inline Hooks feature. There are a number of different types of inline hooks that Okta supports. In this post, I focus on hooks that allow you to patch information into the tokens you get back from okta via OIDC and OAuth. This is a bleeding edge feature and is currently EA (early access) only. You'll be able to enable this feature in your Okta org by following the instructions below.

You'll first set up an OIDC application in Okta and be able to see the types of tokens you get back. Then, you'll configure a Spring Boot API app that allows you to register you're favorite beers (this is based on [previous post]() from my friend and colleague, Matt Raible, who is really into beers). This Spring Boot app also has API endpoints to register token hooks with Okta and to service token patch requests from Okta. Finally, you'll see that your favorite beers are now included in the payload of a token thanks to the hooks you registered.

To get ready for the hands-on parts of this post, set yourself up with the following:

* Create a free Okta developer org at [https://developer.okta.com/signup/](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)
* Install [HTTPie](https://httpie.org), a modern curl replacement for interacting with API endpoints later
* Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), an app that allows public access to a locally running server
* Optional: Create a free Heroku account at [https://signup.heroku.com/](https://signup.heroku.com/)

To start, let's take a step back and introduce OIDC and OAuth.

## Three Minute Overview of OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0

<!-- // TODO - This is copied from a previous post verbatim. Should I change? // -->

In the beginning there were siloed web sites that didn't talk to each other, and it was sad.

Sites like Yelp started wanting access to the contact information you had in your Google Contacts. So, Yelp naturally collected your Google username and password so that it could access your contacts. You gave Yelp your permission, so this was all good, Yes? No! With your username and password, Yelp could access your email, your docs - everything you had in Google - not just your contacts. And, worse, Yelp had to store your password in a way that it could use it in plaintext and there was no standard way to revoke your consent to Yelp to access your Google account.

We needed an authorization framework that would allow you to grant access to certain information without you giving up your password. Cue OAuth.

Three revisions later, we're at OAuth 2.0 (there was 1.0 and 1.0a before it) and all's right with the world. Now, an application like Yelp (a `Client Application`) can request an `Access Token` from a service like Google (an `Authorization Server`). You (the `Resource Owner`) log into Google with your credentials and give your `Consent` to Yelp to access your contacts (and only your contacts). `Access Token` in hand, Yelp makes a request of the Google Contacts API (the `Resource Server`) and gets your contacts. Yelp never sees your password and never has access to anything more than you've consented to. And, you can withdraw your consent at any time.

In this new world of consent and authorization, only one thing was missing: identity. Cue OpenID Connect. OIDC is a thin layer on top of OAuth 2.0 that introduces a new type of token: the Identity Token. Encoded within these cryptographically signed tokens in [JWT](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oidc#access-token) format, is information about the authenticated user. This opened the door to a new level of interoperability and Single SignOn.

OAuth (and by extension OIDC) use a number of defined `Flows` to manage the interactions between the `Client App`, the `Authorization Server` and the `Resource Server`. In this post, you'll focus on the `Authorization Code Flow`. This flow is meant to be kicked off from your browser and goes like this:

1. Yelp wants access to your contacts. It presents a button to link your Google Contacts.
2. When you click the button, you're redirected to Google where you login with your username and password (if you're not already logged in).
3. Google shows you a screen telling you that Yelp would like read-only access to your contacts.
4. Once you give your consent, Google redirects back to Yelp, via your browser, with a temporary code (called an authorization code)
5. Using this code, Yelp contacts Google to trade it for an Access Token
6. Google validates the code and if all checks out, issues an Access Token with limited capabilities (read-only access to your contacts) to Yelp
7. Yelp then presents the Access Token to the Google Contacts API
8. Google Contacts API validates the token and, if the request matches the capabilities identified by the token, returns your contact list to Yelp

## Set Up Your Okta Org for OIDC & OAuth 2.0

In this section, you're going to create an OpenID Connect application in Okta. Then, you'll exercise the OIDC application using a little OIDC playground app I created on Heroku. No coding needed! (That will come later).

After logging in to your Okta org, navigate to **Applications** from the top level menu. Click: **Add Application**. Click the third box over labeled **Web** and click **Next**.

Enter the following:

| field | value |
|-------|-------|
| Name  | OIDC Beers |
| Login redirect URIs | https://okta-oidc-fun.herokuapp.com/flow_result |
| Grant type allowed | Check *Authorization Code* and *Implicit (Hyubrid)* |

{% img blog/token-hooks/oidc_settings.png alt:"oidc settings" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click *Done*.

**Note:** Current best guidance for OAuth 2.0 (as outlined [here]()) is to NOT use the implicit flow. We are using it here for demonstration purposes.

Scroll down and copy the `Client ID` and `Client secret` values. You'll need these later.

You also need to create an API Token for use with the Spring Boot app later, so let's do that now.

Navigate to: **API > Tokens** from the top level menu in your Okta admin console. Click **Create Token**. Name it `hooks` and click **Create Token**.

You'll see a dialog with the `Token Value` showing. Copy that value and save it for later. Click **OK, got it**.

**NOTE:** This is the only time you'll be shown the value of the API Token. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one.

### OIDC Fun on Heroku

I created an OIDC playground application to be able to exercise the different flows available. This will come in handy to see the
OIDC app you just created in action.

Navigate over to [https://okta-oidc-fun.herokuapp.com](https://okta-oidc-fun.herokuapp.com)

You'll see a page with a form and some toggle buttons. Initially, it's set to point to my Okta org. But, you can change it to your Okta org by filling in the form.

Update the values according to the following:

| field | value |
|-------|-------|
| Okta Org | the fully qualified domain for your okta org (NO https://) |
| Authorization Server ID | default |
| OIDC Client ID | The Client ID you copied when you created the OIDC app |
| response_type | DESELECT *code*, Select *id_token* and *token* |

{% img blog/token-hooks/oidc_playground.png alt:"oidc playground" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Scroll down and click the link. A new tab will launch where you can authenticate to your Okta org. Then, you'll be redirected back where you'll see an ID Token and an Access Token. Click *Validate ID Token* and you'll see the payload encoded into that token.

You've now seen the kinds of tokens your OpenID Connect app in Okta can generate.

In the rest of this post, you'll see how you can create a hook that will add custom claims to the ID Token. This happens in-flight, but
before the ID Token is signed. This means that you can still safely validate the cryptographic signature.

Leave this browser tab open. You'll make use of the access token in just a little bit.

## Set Up the Favorite Beers API Application

Go and grab the source code for this post from [GitHub]().

This is a Spring Boot application which uses the Okta Spring Boot Starter for easy integration with OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0.

It uses the [H2]() in memory database and [JPA]() for easy object-relational mapping. It also uses the excellent [Lombok]() project because - Who likes to write getters and setters?

The application has these features:

* API to indicate your favorite beers
* API to create a token inline hook in your Okta org
* API to handle an incoming hook request from Okta and return an id token patch response

In the *src/main/resources* folder, you'll see the `application.sample.yml` file. Copy that over to `application.yml` in the same folder.

You'll need to customize the `application.yml` file with the values you've collected from the set up we did above. This includes the *issuer*, *clientId*, *clientSecret* and *apiToken* values. You can also optionally change the `id` and `password` values to anything you want. These values are used later with the hooks api. Once you have these set, you can run the app like so:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

After the app starts, you'll see output to indicate that the [h2]() in-memory database has been primed with some beers:

```bash
Beer(id=1, name=Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout)
Beer(id=2, name=Marshmallow Handjee)
Beer(id=3, name=Barrel-Aged Abraxas)
Beer(id=4, name=Hunahpu's Imperial Stout)
Beer(id=5, name=King Julius)
Beer(id=6, name=Heady Topper)
Beer(id=7, name=Budweiser)
Beer(id=8, name=Coors Light)
Beer(id=9, name=PBR)
```

### Exercise the Beers Application

You're now going to use the Beers API to add your favorite beer. But, all the api endpoints are protected with OIDC. This is where your access token from earlier comes in. 

Execute the following command to add a beer to your list of favs:

```bash
http \
localhost:8080/api/add-beer \
name=Heineken \
Authorization:"Bearer <your access token>"
```

```
ngrok http 8080
```

```
http \
    --auth admin@okta.com:wKq83CcoiPbM7TT-jnEPVas9mc6BWEv9SMWm0cVg \
    localhost:8080/api/hooks/create-hook \
    oktaOrg=https://oktane19-madly-fear-defeated.oktapreview.com \
    hookUrl=https://37fd87f0.ngrok.io
```

If all goes well, you'll get a response like this:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200
...

[
    {
        "id": 10,
        "name": "Heineken"
    }
]
```

The app has both created a new beer entry and added it to your list of favorites.

**NOTE:** Since the application uses an in-memory database, if you restart the app, you'll need to re-add your favorite beers using this api.

Next up, you'll setup the inline hook that will add the `beers` claim to your ID Token on the fly.

## Get Your Favorite Beers Patched into Your ID Token

In order to make use of your hooks processing api, Okta needs to be able to make calls to it over the public Internet. In "real life", you'd deploy your application somewhere and set it up so that Okta could interact with it.

For demonstration purposes, you're going to use the [ngrok]() service, which issues you a unique, publicly addressable domain that's connected to your locally running Spring Boot application.

Start by issuing this command in a separate terminal tab:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

You'll see output like this:

```bash
ngrok by @inconshreveable                                                                                                                                                                     (Ctrl+C to quit)

```

Copy the https link (`https://e3fc9a95.ngrok.io` in my case) as we'll need it soon.

### To the Bleeding Edge: Setup Okta Inline Hooks

The publicly accessible (thanks to ngrok) Spring Boot app you have running is all setup to receive hook requests from Okta. But, your Okta org isn't ready for it yet.

First, you need to enable the Early Access feature in your Okta org. To do that, Select **Developer Console** in the upper left and choose **Classic UI**.

Click **Settings > Features** from the top level menu. Click **Edit**. Check **Inline Hooks**. Click **Save**. Now you can work with Inline Hooks in your Okta org.

Next, you need to register the inline hook with Okta. There isn't yet a UI for this. You have to make an API call as documented [here]().

However, built into the Spring Boot application is an API endpoint that makes the call to your Okta org on your behalf. It uses the API Token that you configured earlier to do this.

It builds the request to Okta from a template file found in the project at: `src/main/resources/hooks.json`:

```javascript
{
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "name": "APIAM Token Hook with DB lookup",
    "type": "com.okta.oauth2.tokens.transform",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "channel": {
        "type": "HTTP",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "config": {
            "uri": "{{ngrok-url}}/api/hooks/apiam",
            "headers": [{"key": "org", "value": "{{okta-org}}"}],
            "authScheme": {
                "type": "HEADER",
                "key": "Authorization",
                "value": "Basic {{basic-auth}}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `{{ngrok-url}}` variable is the ngrok url you copied earlier. The `{{okta-org}}` variable is your Okta org url. These values are passed in as part of an api call you'll make shortly.

The `{{basic-auth}}` url is computed by the Spring Boot application based on the settings in you `application.yml` file. The `/api/hooks/apiam` endpoint in this Spring Boot app is protected with basic authentication. Okta will pass along the basic authentication header when it makes the hooks call to your app.

The Spring Boot app makes the call to: `{{okta-org}}/api/v1/callbacks` to create the hook definition in your Okta org.

Run the following:

```bash
http \
--auth me@example.com:whatevs \
localhost:8080/api/hooks/create-hook \
oktaOrg=<your okta org url> \
hookUrl=<your https ngrok address>
```

**NOTE:** The value for `--auth` is the default from `application.yml`. If you changed the values there, you'll need to change the values here as well.

You should get back a lot of output. Here's an abbreviated example:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200
...

{
    ...
    "created": "2019-05-29T01:32:25.000Z",
    "id": "calnehjhojByvWHcV356",
    "lastUpdated": "2019-05-29T01:32:25.000Z",
    "name": "APIAM Token Hook with DB lookup",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "type": "com.okta.oauth2.tokens.transform",
    "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

The hook is now created in your okta org.

### Anatomy of a Token Transformation Inline Hook

Before we configure your Authorization Server to make use of the hook, let's take a look at the heart of the code that enables the ID Token to be patched with a list of your favorite beers.

Here's method from the `HooksController`:

```Java
    @PostMapping("/apiam")
    public TokenHookResponse apiam(@RequestBody TokenHookRequest request) {
        String login = request.getData().getContext().getUser().getProfile().getLogin();
        Person p = personRepository.findByEmail(login);

        TokenHookResponse response = new TokenHookResponse();
        if (p != null) {
            IDTokenPatchResponse idTokenPatchResponse = new IDTokenPatchResponse();
            idTokenPatchResponse.getValue().add(
                new TokenPatchResponse.Value("add", "/claims/beers", transformBeers(p.getFavoriteBeers()))
            );
            response.getCommands().add(idTokenPatchResponse);
        }
        return response;
    }

```

The `TokenHookRequest` class makes use of Lombok and some default initialization to ensure that you won't get a `NullPointerException`.

There's a lot to the token hook request that Okta sends into the controller. I've modeled out only what we need by making liberal use of the `@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)` annotation. You can see an example of the complete request json [here](https://developer.okta.com/use_cases/inline_hooks/token_hook/token_hook/#sample-listing-of-json-payload-of-request).

Using the `login` value from the request, the code does a database lookup to retrieve the `Person` associated with that login. When you added to your list of favorite beers earlier, a `Person` record was created for you.

The code then sets up a `TokenHookResponse` which will (potentially) have a list of commands to patch either (or both) the ID Token and Access Token. In this example, we are only going to patch the ID Token.

The critical line is this one:

```java
new TokenPatchResponse.Value("add", "/claims/beers", transformBeers(p.getFavoriteBeers()))
```

Here's where a list of beer names is added to the response attached to the `beers` claim. The JSON response looks like this:

```
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "type": "com.okta.identity.patch",
      "value": [
        {
          "op": "add",
          "path": "/claims/beers",
          "value": ["Heineken"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The last step to tie this all together, is to configure your Authorization Server to user the hook.

### Add Beer to your ID Token

Back in your admin console, Click **Classic UI > Developer Console** in the upper left.

Click **API > Authorization Servers** from the top level menu. Click **default**. Click **Access Policies**. Scroll down and click the pencil icon next to the `Default Policy Rule`.

Select **APIAM Token Hook with DB lookup** from the `Use this inline hook` menu.

{% img blog/token-hooks/auth_server_rule.png alt:"auth server rule" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click **Update Rule**.

Open up a browser tab and navigate to `localhost:4040`. This is the ngrok monitoring interface.

Now, you can return to the OIDC playground from before. Close the results tab with the ID Token and Access Token. Click the link once again from the playground page. Click **Validate ID Token** and et voilà - you'll see the `beers` claim with any beers you've added to your favorites.

{% img blog/token-hooks/altered_id_token.png alt:"id tokens" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Switch back to the ngrok monitoring tab and you can see the request from okta and the response from the Spring Boot app.

## Learn More About Secure Single Sign-on, OAuth 2.0, and Spring Boot

The Okta Spring Boot Starter enables you to integrate your Spring Boot apps with Okta with just a few lines of code and three configuration properties.

Along with our Spring Boot Starter, Okta's OpenID Connect service not only conforms to the standard, but gives you a sophisticated Single Sign-On experience where the same user can access many different OIDC applications, each with their own set of requirements and configuration. Remember: OIDC rides on top of OAuth 2.0 - it's not standalone. Whereas OAuth focuses exclusively on authorization, OIDC explicitly adds identity and authentication concerns.
