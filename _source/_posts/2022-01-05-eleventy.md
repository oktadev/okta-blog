## Introduction to 11ty

11ty is an amazing tool for quickly creating static sites using a variety of templating languages.  11ty is designed to make the process of designing and developing static sites simple.  It features support for HTML, markdown, javascript, nunjucks, handlebars, and many more.  It has built-in support for layouts, pagination, and slugify.  The framework is as simple and powerful as they claim it to be.  

## Integrating 11ty with Okta

In this tutorial, you will learn how to secure your 11ty site using Okta.  11ty will produce static pages which means you won't have the luxury of servers and states to help manage your authentication.  But Okta still has a solution for this.  You will use the [Okta Sign-In Widget](https://developer.okta.com/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget/) to authenticate users.  Then you will store the `id token` returned from the Okta authentication server.  You can then use that `id token` to query Okta's servers for many operations, including [vertifying if the token is valid](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#introspect) or obtaining user information.  

## Create your Okta Application

{% include setup/cli.md type="spa" framework="Vue"
   loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080/callback" signup="false" %}

## Create your 11ty Site

The next step is to create your 11ty site.  First, create your project directory.

```console
mkdir sample_blog
cd sample_blog
```

Next, create your node application and install 11ty.

```console
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev @11ty/eleventy@1.0.0
```

At this point, your 11ty site is ready to run.  You can give a test by adding a new page.

```console
echo '<!doctype html><html><head><title>Page title</title></head><body><p>Hello World</p></body></html>' > index.html
```

Then you can run the command `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`.  By default 11ty will attempt to use port `8080` on localhost, so navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and you can see your **Hello World** page.  A quick note here, if you are using Windows you will need to open the index file you just created and resave it with `UTF-8` encoding as 11ty uses `UTF-16 LE` by default.  

## Add a Couple of Static Pages

Now you can add some content to your site.  Your site will consist of an index page to greet users, a login page, a readme to demonstrate the usage of markdown, and a page that is under authentication.  

First, open the `index.html` file you just created and replace the code with the following.

```HTML
---
layout: _layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js
---

<div class="row align-items-md-stretch">
    <div class="col-md-12">
        <div class="h-100 p-5 text-white bg-secondary rounded-3">
            <h2>Using Okta with 11ty</h2>
            <p>A small tutorial on writing static sites with 
                <a class="text-dark" href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">11ty</a>, 
                secured by <a class="text-dark" href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank">Okta</a>
                written by <a class="text-dark" href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com/" target="_blank">Nik Fisher.</a>
            </p>
            <a class="btn btn-outline-light" role="button" href="Login">Login Now</a>
            <a class="btn btn-light" role="button" href="README">README</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

You will notice the `layout` variable at the top of the.  You will add your layout pages later in this tutorial but take notes that you will need to assign a layout to each page if you wish.

Next, create a file for `login.html` and add the following code.  

```HTML
---
layout: _layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js
---

<div id="okta-login-container"></div>
<script>
  oktaSignIn.authClient.token.getUserInfo().then(function(user) {
    window.location='/protected';
  },function(error) {
    oktaSignIn.showSignInToGetTokens({
      el: '#okta-login-container'
    }).then(function(tokens) {
      oktaSignIn.authClient.tokenManager.setTokens(tokens);
      oktaSignIn.remove();
      window.location='/protected';
    }).catch(function(err) {
      console.error(err);
    });
  });
</script>
```

This page has a bit more to it.  The only HTML here is a `div` with `id="okta-login-container"`.  You call the `OktaSignIn` features and display the login screen to the user in The javascript of this page.  Okta will take care of creating the login form and handling the actual authentication.  All you need to do is capture the token on the back and store the token.  Once you have done that you will redirect the user to the `protected` page.  

You can add the protected page now.  Add the code below to it.

```HTML
---
layout: _layout_authenticated.11ty.js
---

<div id="content"></div>

<script>
    function loadPage(){
        //replace with API call 
        document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = "<h2>Congrats</h2><h5>You've reached a protected page</h5>"
    }
</script>
```

Since you haven't seen the `_layout_authenticated.11ty.js` page yet, this will need some explanation.  The `loadPage` function is called the layout after verifying the user is authenticated.  There's a comment to replace the code here with an API call.  You could accomplish this with an API or a serverless implementation using something like AWS Lambda.  In either case, you could pass the token in the token and verify it on the server side before displaying any content to the user.

Finally, add a page for `README.md` and add the following markdown to it.

```markdown

# Build a Website with 11ty (Eleventy)

This repository shows you how to use Okta on a static site built with 11ty. Please read [Build a Website with 11ty (Eleventy)][blog] to see how it was created.

**Prerequisites:**

- [Node 10 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)

> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage and secure users and roles in any application.

* [Getting Started](#getting-started)
* [Links](#links)
* [Help](#help)
* [License](#license)

## Getting Started

To run this example, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickolasfisher/Okta_Eleventy
cd sample_blog
```

### Create an OIDC Application in Okta

Create a free developer account with the following command using the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com):

```shell
okta register
```

If you already have a developer account, use `okta login` to integrate it with the Okta CLI. 

Provide the required information. Once you register, create a client application in Okta with the following command:

```shell
okta apps create
```

You will be prompted to select the following options:
- Type of Application: **2: Single Page App**
- Redirect URI: `https://localhost:8080/`
- Post Logout Redirect URI: `https://localhost:8080/callback`

The application configuration will be printed to `.okta.env`.

```dotenv
export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="{yourClientId}"
```

Open the file `_includes/_layout_base.11ty.js` and update the code.

```javascript
      const oktaSignIn=new OktaSignIn({
         baseUrl: "{{yourOktaDomain}}",
         redirectUri: 'http://localhost:8080/',
         clientId: "{{yourClientId}}",
         authParams: {
               issuer: "{{yourOktaDomain}}/oauth2/default"
         }
      });     
```

## Start the Application.

Run the command `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve` and then open `https://localhost:8080` in your favorite browser and you should be able to see the home page.

## Links

This example uses the following open source libraries from Okta:

* [Okta Signin Widget](https://developer.okta.com/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget/)
* [Okta CLI](https://github.com/okta/okta-cli)

## Add Layout Pages

It's now time to add the layout pages that will sit under your static files.  11ty enables you to write layouts in several templating languages.  For this project, you will use the stock `11ty.js` format.  Create a new folder called `_includes` using the command `mkdir _includes`.  Add a file called `_layout_base.11ty.js` and add the code below to it.

```javascript
exports.data = {

};

exports.render = function (data) {
  return `<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
        integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
        integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p"
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/5.14.1/js/okta-sign-in.min.js"
        type="text/javascript"></script>
    <link href="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/5.14.1/css/okta-sign-in.min.css" type="text/css"
        rel="stylesheet" />
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>${data.title}</title>
</head>

<body>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        const oktaSignIn=new OktaSignIn({
            baseUrl: "{{yourOktaDomain}}",
            redirectUri: 'http://localhost:8080/callback',
            clientId: "{{yourClientId}}",
            authParams: {
                issuer: "{{yourOktaDomain}}/oauth2/default"
            }
        });     
    </script>
    <div class="container">
        ${data.content}
    </div>

</body>

</html>`;
};
```

This file will be the base layout for all of your pages.  This file loads `bootstrap` into all of your pages.  It also initializes the `OktaSignIn` widget on each page.  This way you can access it in the javascript of your file no matter where you are.

Next, add a file for `_layout_unauthenticated.11ty.js`.

```javascript
exports.data = {
  title: "11ty And Okta",
  layout:  "_layout_base.11ty.js"
};

exports.render = function (data) {
  return `
     <header class="d-flex flex-wrap align-items-center justify-content-center justify-content-md-between py-3 mb-4 border-bottom">
      <a href="/" class="d-flex align-items-center col-md-3 mb-2 mb-md-0 text-dark text-decoration-none">
       Home
      </a>

      <div class="col-md-3 text-end">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary me-2"><a href="Login">Login</a></button>
      </div>
    </header>

    ${data.content}
        
        `;
};
```

This file extends the base layout you just created by creating a header with a `Home` button and a `Login` button that will direct the user to the `Login` page with your Okta sign-in widget.

Finally, add a new file called `_layout_authenticated.11ty.js`.  Add the code below to it.

```javascript
exports.data = {
title: "11ty And Okta",
layout: "_layout_base.11ty.js",
};

exports.render = function (data) {
return `

<header
    class="d-flex flex-wrap align-items-center justify-content-center justify-content-md-between py-3 mb-4 border-bottom">
    <a href="/" class="d-flex align-items-center col-md-3 mb-2 mb-md-0 text-dark text-decoration-none">
        Home
    </a>

    <div class="col-md-3 text-end">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary me-2" onclick='logout()'>Logout</button>
    </div>
</header>

${data.content}

<script type="text/javascript">
    function logout() {
        oktaSignIn.authClient.signOut();
        location.reload();
    }

    if(!oktaSignIn?.authClient?.token) {
        window.location='/Login';
    }

    oktaSignIn.authClient.token.getUserInfo().then(function(user) {
        if(loadPage) {
            loadPage();
        }
    }).catch(function(e) {
        console.log(e);
        window.location='/Login'
    });
</script>
`;
};
```

Again, this file will extend the base layout.  It also adds some additional functionality to each page using this out.  When the page loads it will attempt to contact the Okta authorization server to obtain information about the user with the id token stored in the browser.  If that request is successful it will call the `loadPage` function implemented in those pages.  Otherwise, it redirects the user to the `Login` page.  This page also contains a header with a `Logout` button and a method for `logout` that uses the sign-in widget to log the user out.

## Start your site

If you are still running the site then 11ty would have hot reloaded the site and you should see the home page.  If not, run the command `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`.  The command will build your templates into static pages and then serve the site on `localhost:8080`.  Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the home page.

{% img blog/eleventy/Home Page.png alt:"Home Page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, click the login button to see the Okta Sign-in widget in action.  You can log in with your Okta credentials and see the protected page.
