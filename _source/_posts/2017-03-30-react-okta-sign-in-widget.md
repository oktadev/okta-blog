React has quickly become one of the most favored front-end web frameworks, and is second only to plain old HTML5, [according to JAXenter](https://jaxenter.com/technology-trends-2017-top-frameworks-131993.html). So it's no surprise that [developers are learning it](https://www.lynda.com/React-js-training-tutorials/7049-0.html), and [employers are asking for it](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?sort=i&q=ReactJS).

In this tutorial, you'll start with a very simple React app with a couple of pages and some routing built in, and add authentication using [Okta's Sign-In Widget](/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget). The Sign-In Widget is an embeddable Javascript widget that allows developers to use Okta's secure, scalable architecture with a minimum of effort from within React applications. Let's get started!
## Get the Simple React Seed Project
Start by cloning the simple React seed project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leebrandt/simple-react-seed.git okta-react-widget-sample
cd okta-react-widget-sample
```

## Add the Okta Sign-In Widget

Install the [Okta Sign-In Widget](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget) using npm.

```bash
npm install @okta/okta-signin-widget@2.3.0 --save
```

This will add the Okta Sign-In Widget code to your `node_modules` folder. We'll be using version 2.3.0 of the Sign-In Widget.

{% img blog/react-sign-in-widget/Okta-Widget-NPM-Modules-Screener.png alt:"Okta in node_modules" %}

Then add the styles for the widget in your `index.html` file from the Okta CDN. Add these lines inside the `<head>` tag:

```html
    <link
     href="https://ok1static.oktacdn.com/assets/js/sdk/okta-signin-widget/2.3.0/css/okta-sign-in.min.css"
      type="text/css"
      rel="stylesheet"/>

    <!-- Theme file: Customize or replace this file if you want to override our default styles -->
    <link
      href="https://ok1static.oktacdn.com/assets/js/sdk/okta-signin-widget/2.3.0/css/okta-theme.css"
      type="text/css"
      rel="stylesheet"/>
```

## The LoginPage Component

First, create a folder called `auth` in the `./src/components` folder, then create a file called `LoginPage.js` where the `LoginPage` component will go.

Start with the most basic of components:

```js
import React from 'react';

export default class LoginPage extends React.Component{
  render(){
    return(
      <div>Login Page</div>
    );
  }
}
```

This little component doesn't *do* much but at least you now have a handle to add the `LoginPage` to your routing. So in your `./src/app.js` file, you'll import the component at the top:

```js
import LoginPage from './components/auth/LoginPage';
```

and then add the route inside the main route (the one with the path of "/")

```js
<Route path="/login" component={LoginPage}/>
```

## Add the OpenID Connect Application in Okta

In order to use Okta as your OpenID Connect provider for authentication, you'll need to set up an application in the [Okta developer console](https://developer.okta.com).

If you don't have an Okta developer account, [go create one](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)! Once you're logged in, click on **Applications** in the top navbar, then click **Add Application**. Select SPA as the platform and click Next. Change the redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000`, and click Done. The application will be created with the following settings:

{% img blog/react-sign-in-widget/react-sample-app-settings.png alt:"OIDC Application Settings" width:"800" %}

Now that you have an application created in Okta, you can set up the widget to talk to your new app!

## Add the Widget to Your Component

```js
import React from 'react';
import OktaSignIn from '@okta/okta-signin-widget';

export default class LoginPage extends React.Component{
  constructor(){
    super();
    this.widget = new OktaSignIn({
      baseUrl: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}',
      clientId: '{clientId}',
      redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000',
      authParams: {
        issuer: 'default',
        responseType: 'id_token'
      }
    });
  }

  render(){
    return(
      <div>Login Page</div>
    );
  }
}
```

Copy the Client ID generated from your application's settings page and paste it over `{clientId}`. Make sure you also replace `{yourOktaDomain}` with your Okta organization URL, which you can find by going back to the main Dashboard page in the developer console. It will look like: `https://{yourOktaDomain}`.

Thus far you've imported the `OktaSignIn` function from the [Okta Sign-In Widget](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget) `npm` module you installed earlier. Next, in the constructor of the component, you initialized an instance of `OktaSignIn` with the configuration for the application. This way, the application code will be able to talk to Okta and Okta will recognize that this is the app you just created.

## Show The Login Widget

Next, you'll create the code to actually render the Sign-In Widget to the page! You'll need to change your render method to create an HTML element  you can render the widget into. Make sure to get a [reference to the element](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) that will be rendered. Then, add a `componentDidMount` function to make sure you don't try to render the widget before the HTML element is on the page.

```js
import React from 'react';
import OktaSignIn from '@okta/okta-signin-widget';

export default class LoginPage extends React.Component{
  constructor(){
    super();
    this.state = {user:null};
    this.widget = new OktaSignIn({
      baseUrl: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}',
      clientId: '{clientId}',
      redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000',
      authParams: {
        issuer: 'default',
        responseType: 'id_token'
      }
    });
  }

  componentDidMount(){
    this.widget.renderEl({el:this.loginContainer},
      (response) => {
        this.setState({user: response.claims.email});
      },
      (err) => {
        console.log(err);
      }
    );
  }

  render(){
    return(
     <div ref={(div) => {this.loginContainer = div; }} />
    );
  }
}
```

You also added state to your component. If you're using a flux implementation, this would naturally come from the app state. But to keep this tutorial simple, let your `LoginPage` keep track of it's own state.

## Check Whether the User is Logged In

We're almost there, but you don't necessarily want to render the widget right away. You'll need to add a check to make sure the user isn't already logged in, and move your `renderEl` out to a function called `showLogin`.

```js
 // ...other stuff removed for brevity's sake
 componentDidMount(){
    this.widget.session.get((response) => {
      if(response.status !== 'INACTIVE'){
        this.setState({user:response.login});
      }else{
        this.showLogin();
      }
    });
  }

  showLogin(){
    Backbone.history.stop();
    this.widget.renderEl({el:this.loginContainer},
      (response) => {
        this.setState({user: response.claims.email});
      },
      (err) => {
        console.log(err);
      }
    );
  }
```

You might have noticed a weird bit of code in that `showLogin` method. That first line: `Backbone.history.stop()`. The widget itself uses [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) to navigate between its own screens (login, forgot password, etc.), and when it renders, it starts the `Backbone.history`. Since you've now moved it out into a `showLogin` function, the widget is going to re-render whenever the function is called. So this is just a little trick to tell Backbone to stop the history, because it's going to restart when the widget is rendered.

## The Final LoginPage React Component

Let's wrap this up. Make sure you bind the class's `this` context to each of your methods. Add a `logout` method, and change your `render` method to make a decision on what to render, based on whether there is a currently logged in user.

So the final version of `LoginPage.js` should look like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import OktaSignIn from '@okta/okta-signin-widget';

export default class LoginPage extends React.Component{
  constructor(){
    super();
    this.state = { user: null };
    this.widget = new OktaSignIn({
      baseUrl: 'https://{oktaOrgUrl}',
      clientId: '{clientId}',
      redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000',
      authParams: {
        responseType: 'id_token'
      }
    });

    this.showLogin = this.showLogin.bind(this);
    this.logout = this.logout.bind(this);
  }

  componentDidMount(){
    this.widget.session.get((response) => {
      if(response.status !== 'INACTIVE'){
        this.setState({user:response.login});
      }else{
        this.showLogin();
      }
    });
  }

  showLogin(){
    Backbone.history.stop();
    this.widget.renderEl({el:this.loginContainer},
      (response) => {
        this.setState({user: response.claims.email});
      },
      (err) => {
        console.log(err);
      }
    );
  }

  logout(){
    this.widget.signOut(() => {
      this.setState({user: null});
      this.showLogin();
    });
  }

  render(){
    return(
      <div>
        {this.state.user ? (
          <div className="container">
            <div>Welcome, {this.state.user}!</div>
            <button onClick={this.logout}>Logout</button>
          </div>
        ) : null}
        {this.state.user ? null : (
          <div ref={(div) => {this.loginContainer = div; }} />
        )}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Add a Login Link

React is now wired up to handle the `/login` route and display the Okta Sign-In Widget to prompt the user to log in.

Add a Login link to the top navbar by editing `./src/components/common/Navigation.js` and adding a new link under the existing Contact link:

```html
<li><Link to="login">Login</Link></li>
```

## Check It Out

Now install the npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

When you run the app now (with `npm start`), you should see something like this:

{% img blog/react-sign-in-widget/Finished-Sample-Screener.gif alt:"Finished Sample" %}

If you have any problems with the application, one thing to try first is, delete the `node_modules` folder **and** the `package-lock.json` file and re-run the `npm install` command. This should fix any problems with package dependency management.

If it works - congrats! If it doesn't, please post a question to Stack Overflow with an [okta tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/okta), or hit me up on Twitter [@leebrandt](https://twitter.com/leebrandt).

## React + Okta
