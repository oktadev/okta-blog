With the increasing popularity of single-page apps and the growing API economy, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are becoming a very popular method for authenticating users. Rather than relying on the server to store the user's state, JWTs encode information in a keyed payload stored on the client.

JWTs are not inherently less secure than server-side session storage. But developers should understand the tradeoffs and know what to do [if a JWT is compromised](/blog/2018/06/20/what-happens-if-your-jwt-is-stolen). You should expire JWTs frequently and always [validate them before trusting them in your application](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/validate-access-tokens/go/overview/).

If you're using JWTs properly, they provide several benefits. For single-page applicationsâ€”where much of the heavy-lifting is done in the browserâ€”JWTs make a lot of sense. Assuming the client can decode the JWT and verify its signature, it doesn't need to make another trip back to the server to authenticate the user. JWTs also make sense for highly performant, globally-distributed server-side applications. By storing user information in the JWT, each node can authenticate the user locally rather than querying an authentication service on every request.

{% img blog/protecting-a-laravel-api-with-jwt/architecture.jpg alt:"Traditional session-based authentication vs. JWT-based authentication" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

In this tutorial, you'll create a Laravel API that uses JWTs provided by [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) to authenticate users. You'll use custom [Laravel middleware](https://laravel.com/docs/middleware) and the [Okta JWT Verifier package](https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-php) to verify requests and restrict access to your API to authenticated users. If you'd like to download the final codebase, [it's available on GitHub](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-laravel-jwt-example). Otherwise, read on for the step-by-step process.

## Using JWT Authentication to Secure a Laravel API

In this tutorial, you'll use Okta to generate a JWT that allows users to call your API securely. You'll then verify the JWT using Okta's JWT Verifier package to ensure that users have a valid, non-expired token before they get your data. To keep this example simple, you'll use a client credentials grant, but the same JWT returned in [standard Laravel authentication with Okta](/blog/2019/09/05/laravel-authentication) would also work.

**Prerequisites:** Please ensure you have already installed PHP, Composer, and have signed up for a [free Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

## Setting Up a New Laravel Application

Before adding the API endpoints and authentication packages, you will need a fresh Laravel application with a database table and model. For this tutorial, you'll create a `Location` model and database table that includes the names of several locations and their desirability on a scale of 1-10.

If you already have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed, you can use it to create a new Laravel application from your command line:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel okta-laravel-jwt
```

Then you'll need to `cd` into the folder and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd okta-laravel-jwt
composer install
php artisan key:generate
```

> **Note:** This tutorial assumes you are using [Laravel 8](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x). While not considerably different from previous versions, you may notice some import paths have changed, so be sure to adjust this for your version of Laravel.

Laravel abstracts away most differences between database providers, so you can use any database you like, but the simplest way to get started is with [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html). To use SQLite, create a new file to house your database:

```bash
touch database/database.sqlite
```

And update the `DB_CONNECTION` environment variable in your `.env` file to `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite`. Remove all the other `DB_` environment variables as you don't need them for a SQLite connection.

Next, use the [Laravel Artisan command](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/artisan) to create a new model and migration file:

```bash
php artisan make:model Location --migration
```

You will need to allow mass-assignment of the `name` and `desirability` attributes on this model, so open up the `app/Models/Location.php` model file. Add the following `$fillable` property to the class:

```php
...
class Location extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'desirability'];
}
```

Next, you'll need to add the model's attributes to the database using the migration. Open up the new migration file Laravel created when you ran the above Artisan command. It should be the last file in your `database/migrations` folder. Modify the `up()` method to include the `name` and `desirability` fields:

```php
...
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('locations', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        $table->string('name');
        $table->unsignedInteger('desirability');
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}
...
```


Commit the migration to your database using the migration Artisan command:


```bash
php artisan migrate
```


Finally, before you build the endpoints for your API, you can create some default seed data using [Laravel's Database Seeder](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/seeding). Open up the `database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php` file and replace the contents with the following:


```php
<?php
namespace Database\Seeder;

use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
use App\Models\Location;

class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Seed the application's database.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run()
    {
        DB::table('locations')->truncate();
        Location::create(['name' => 'Aruba', 'desirability' => 10]);
        Location::create(['name' => 'Jamaica', 'desirability' => 10]);
        Location::create(['name' => 'Bermuda', 'desirability' => 10]);
        Location::create(['name' => 'Bahama', 'desirability' => 10]);
        Location::create(['name' => 'Key Largo', 'desirability' => 10]);
        Location::create(['name' => 'Montego', 'desirability' => 10]);
    }
}
```

Run the seeder via the Artisan command to reset the database and create the six new locations:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

Your Laravel application, database table, and model are now ready. In the next step, you'll add the API endpoints needed to retrieve, create, and delete data from this table.

## Adding and Testing the API Endpoints

In a production application, you'll probably want to create a controller to contain your API's business logic. Because this is just a demonstration, you can do all the work in [Laravel's route file](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/routing). Open up the `routes/api.php` file and replace it with the following:


```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Models\Location;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

Route::prefix('locations')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', fn() => Location::all());
    Route::post('/', fn(Request $request) => Location::create($request->all()));
    Route::delete('/{id}', fn(int $id) => Location::destroy($id));
});
```

The first route will return all locations when `GET /api/locations` is called, the second will create a new location when `POST /api/locations` is called, and the third will delete a location based on the `{id}` you pass into the `DELETE /api/locations/{id}` call. To test these new endpoints out, start your local Laravel server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

You can use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to call each endpoint described above. For example, when I call `http://localhost:8000/api/locations` in Postman, I get the following JSON response back:


```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Aruba",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Jamaica",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Bermuda",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Bahama",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Key Largo",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "name": "Montego",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    }
]
```

Now that your API is set up, you are ready to add JWT authentication.

## Adding the Okta JWT Verifier

[Middleware](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/middleware) is usually the best place for custom authentication and request validation logic. In this step, you'll create a new Laravel middleware, use the Okta JWT verifier to make sure the user has passed a valid JWT in as their bearer token, and add this middleware to all of the `/api/locations` routes described above.

First, install the [Okta JWT verifier](https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-php) package and its peer dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer require okta/jwt-verifier firebase/php-jwt guzzlehttp/psr7 http-interop/http-factory-guzzle
```

The JWT adapter we'll use is `firebase/php-jwt`, `guzzlehttp/psr7` provides HTTP interfaces for the API requests this library makes to Okta's servers, and the `http-interop/http-factory-guzzle` adds PSR-17 support. The `guzzlehttp/psr7` library will be getting this [support in version 2.0](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7/issues/327), but in the meantime, the interop library allows you to fill in the missing pieces.


To use the JWT verifier, you'll need a new Okta application with a Client ID and the Issuer URI of your Okta Authorization Server.


Log in to your Okta account and go to **API > Authorization Servers**. Copy the **Issuer URI** and add it as the environment variable `OKTA_ISSUER_URI` in your Laravel application.

{% img blog/protecting-a-laravel-api-with-jwt/issuer-uri.png alt:"Retrieving your Okta Issuer URI" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

To create a new server application, go to **Applications** and click the **Add Application** button in the top left. Select **Service, Machine-to-Machine** and click **Next**.

{% img blog/protecting-a-laravel-api-with-jwt/create-service-app.png alt:"Creating a new service application in Okta" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Enter a name for your application and click **Next** again.

{% img blog/protecting-a-laravel-api-with-jwt/enter-application-name.png alt:"Entering a name for your application in Okta" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from this page and add them to your Laravel application's `.env` file as `OKTA_CLIENT_ID` and `OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET` respectively.

{% img blog/protecting-a-laravel-api-with-jwt/client-id-secret.png alt:"Retrieving your client credentials in Okta" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Now that you have your Okta application and credentials, you are ready to use them to verify JWTs in Laravel. Create a new middleware using the Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan make:middleware VerifyJwt
```

Open up the new file at `app/Http/Middleware/VerifyJwt.php` and replace the contents with the following:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\Adaptors\FirebasePhpJwt;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\JwtVerifierBuilder;

class VerifyJwt
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        // Instantiate the Okta JWT verifier
        $jwtVerifier = (new JwtVerifierBuilder())
            ->setAdaptor(new FirebasePhpJwt())
            ->setAudience('api://default')
            ->setClientId(env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'))
            ->setIssuer(env('OKTA_ISSUER_URI'))
            ->build();

        try {
            // Verify the JWT passed as a bearer token
            $jwtVerifier->verify($request->bearerToken());
            return $next($request);
        } catch (\Exception $exception) {
            // Log exceptions
            Log::error($exception);
        }

        // If we couldn't verify, assume the user is unauthorized
        return response('Unauthorized', 401);
    }
}
```

To use this middleware, you need to add it to your `Kernel` class and routes. Open `app/Http/Kernel.php` and add the following to your `$routeMiddleware` array:

```php
...
'jwt' => \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyJwt::class,
...
```


Next, open your `routes/api.php` file again and add the middleware to your `locations` route group:


```php
...
Route::prefix('locations')->middleware('jwt')->group(function () {
...
```


This applies the new middleware to every endpoint within the group, but you could apply it selectively to specific routes if you wanted.


Restart your Laravel application and try the endpoints again. This time, the API will return a `401 Unauthorized` response because you have not added a valid JWT to your request. In the last section, you'll issue a JWT and use it to make requests to the API.


## Issuing JWTs

Before you can issue a JWT and use it to authenticate users trying to access your new Laravel API, you need to create a custom scope in Okta to provide access. Go back to the **API > Authorization Servers** page in the Okta Developer Console and click the pencil icon to edit the authorization server.

{% img blog/protecting-a-laravel-api-with-jwt/edit-authorization-server.png alt:"Editing your Okta authorization server" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click the **Scopes** tab and then the **Add Scopes** button.

{% img blog/protecting-a-laravel-api-with-jwt/add-scopes.png alt:"Adding a scope to your Okta authorization server, step 1" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Give your scope a **Name** and **Display phrase** so you can identify it. In this example we'll use `locations_api` for the scope name. Click **Create** when you're finished.

{% img blog/protecting-a-laravel-api-with-jwt/add-scopes-2.png alt:"Adding a scope to your Okta authorization server, step 2" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Now that your Okta authorization server has a new scope specifically for your new API, you can get an access token with this scope. For demonstration purposes, you'll use the Client Credentials grant to get an access token without user interaction. In a real application, you would likely have the application use an OAuth login flow and then issue the access token to the client application.

On the command line, use `curl` to get an access token, replacing the placeholder values in the command below with your own application's client ID and secret:


```bash
curl https://dev-XXXXXX.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token \
  -d grant_type=client_credentials \
  -d client_id=OKTA_CLIENT_ID \
  -d client_secret=OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET \
  -d scope=locations_api
```


When you run this command, Okta will issue an access token and return a JSON object which contains the JWT in a field called `access_token`.


```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiI5b1o2N...",
    "scope": "locations_api"
}
```


Copy the value of the `access_token` field. Make a `GET` call to the `http://localhost:8000/api/locations` endpoint with the JWT in your `Authorization` header as a bearer token. In curl, the request will look like this:


```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8000/api/locations' --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiI5b1o2N...'
```


Laravel will use the Okta JWT verifier you added to your new middleware to verify and decode your token. If it's valid and not expired, you should see the same list of locations as you did before you added authentication to the app. The same bearer token can be used to access the  `POST` and `DELETE` endpoints until the JWT expires.


While this application used a machine-to-machine application to generate a JWT, you could use any Okta-issued JWT with the proper scopes to get the same access to the API above. This decoupling of authentication from your application logic is one of the most significant advantages of using a third-party authentication provider like Okta. It allows you to build scalable, distributed, and secure Laravel APIs.
