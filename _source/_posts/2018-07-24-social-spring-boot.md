We've all seen social login. It's the "Log in with Facebook" or "Log in with Twitter" buttons we see below every username and password field on the Internet. But why do these exist?

The primary benefits of social login are ease of use and security. It's easier for your users to log into your app if they can use credentials they've already created on a a service they trust. They don't have to come up with YET ANOTHER password, which they'll likely name after their dog, to which they'll add an exclamation point and/or a number to get past the password strength filter, and then scrawl it on a sticky note and slap it on their desk or computer monitor or email it to themselves, a process they've now repeated more than 200 hundred times. Ridiculous, and not really desirable user behavior, right?

So, if you allow your users to register and authenticate with a social media account, and everyone will be happier (except perhaps Russian hackers). Just encourage them to turn on 2-factor authentication if your website deals with particularly sensitive data. (Okta can can help you with that too!)

OK, so, social login is awesome! Right? Do you know what's not awesome? Having to re-implement the login API every time Facebook or Google decides to update their specifications. Not to mention having to implement different login specs for different social providers, and style and manage all of the different login buttons. That's where Okta steps in. 

## Why Okta for Social Login in Spring Boot?

If you deploy Okta to handle your social login, when Linkedin decides to update their login API spec for the third time in a week to combat Russian hackers, you won't even know about it. It'll already be handled.

In this tutorial we're going to demonstrate how to use Okta social login with a Spring app written in Java. In particular, we're going to use Google and Facebook. We're also going to demonstrate how to use a custom, self-hosted login page.

The default application settings are fine to get us started. We'll need to make a few changes.

## Get Started: Download and Configure Your Spring Boot Example App

Happily, Okta has an example Spring Boot app configured for you. Go ahead and [download it from the repo](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-social-example).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-social-example.git
cd okta-spring-social-example
```

{% include setup/cli.md type="web"
loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback"
logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080" %}

The first thing you'll want to do is to **copy the `src/main/resources/application.template.yml` to `src/main/resources/application.yml`** and fill in the necessary information from the generated `.okta.env` file.

Then, you should be able to run `./mvnw` from the terminal to run the app (you only need to type `./mvnw` because the `pom.xml` specifies a default goal of `spring-boot:run`, so typing `./mvnw` is the same as typing `./mvnw spring-boot:run`). 

To test the app, **log out of your Okta developer account** and go to `http://localhost:8080` (or open an incognito window).

If all goes well, you'll be redirected to the example app welcome screen that says: "Social Login, Custom Login, and Spring Boot Example".

Click the **Login** button and you will be taken to a custom, locally hosted login page.

Once you log in you'll see a welcome message with your email address and a bit that says:

> You have successfully authenticated against your Okta org...

Now we're ready to configure Google and Facebook for social login!

## Configure Google and Facebook for Social Login in Your Spring Boot App

Okta [has some great documentation](https://developer.okta.com/authentication-guide/social-login/) on configuring social login, including some tips for specific social providers.

### Facebook

Here are the steps you need to follow to configure Facebook for Okta social login:

* Go to [https://developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/) and register for a developer account if you haven't already done so.
* Head over to the Facebook App Dashboard: [https://developers.facebook.com/apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).
* Create a Facebook app. Instructions for creating a Facebook application can be found here: [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register).
* Once you've created your facebook app, go to the app dashboard, click the **Settings** link on the left-hand side, and select the **Basic** submenu.
* Save the **App ID** and **App Secret** values. You'll need them later.
* You'll also need to add a **Facebook Login** product. From the left menu, click the **+** sign next to products and add a **Facebook Login** product.
* Configure the **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** to include your redirect URI with your Okta org URL: `https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback`
* Save changes

### Google

Here are the steps you need to follow to configure Google for Okta social login:

* Go to [https://console.developers.google.com/](https://console.developers.google.com/) and register for a developer account.
* Create a Google API Console project.
* Once your Google App is open, click on the **Credentials** menu and then **Create Credentials** followed by **OAuth client ID**.
* Select **Web Application** type for the OAuth client type.
* Give the client a name. 
* Fill in your redirect URL in the **Authorized redirect URIs**. It's the same one you used for Facebook and ends with `/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback`.
* Click **Create**.
* Copy the client ID and client secret, as you'll need them later.

## Configure Okta to use Facebook and Google for Social Login

Log into your developer.okta.com dashboard. Under the **Users** top menu, select the **Social Identity and Providers** item. 

From the **Add Identity Providers** dropdown, select **Facebook**.

Give it a name, something clever like "Log in with Facebook", and enter your client ID and client secret values (you did save those, right?). Everything else can stay the same.

Click **Add Identity Provider**

Repeat this process for Google, using the client ID and client secret from your Google OAuth 2.0 client IDs.

Your Okta Identity Providers page should now have two "IdP IDs" - you'll need these in a moment.

## Customize the Self-Hosted Sign-In Page for Your Spring Boot App

The final step is to update the Okta Sign-in Widget on your customized sign-in page. This part is ridiculously easy.  You'll need the IdP IDs from above. 

Open the `src/main/resources/templates/login.html` file and take a look at the JavaScript block at the bottom of the page. You configure the identity providers in the Okta Sign-In Widget's config using the `idps` property. 

See the commented section of code below.

```js
config.baseUrl = /*[[${oktaBaseUrl}]]*/ 'https://{yourOktaDomain}';
config.clientId = /*[[${oktaClientId}]]*/ '{clientId}';
config.redirectUri = /*[[${redirectUri}]]*/ '{redirectUri}';
config.logo = '/img/icon-spring-cloud.svg';
config.authParams = {
  issuer: /*[[${issuerUri}]]*/ '{issuerUri}',
  responseType: 'code',
  pkce: false,
  state: /*[[${state}]]*/ '{state}' || false,
  nonce: /*[[${nonce}]]*/ '{nonce}',
  scopes: /*[[${scopes}]]*/ '[scopes]',
  display: 'page'
};

/*********************************************************/
/* ADD ME TO CONFIGURE SOCIAL LOGIN!!!                   */
config.idps = [  
   {type: 'FACEBOOK', id: '<< Your Facebook IdP ID >>'},  
   {type: 'GOOGLE', id: '<< Your Google IdP ID >>' }  
];  
/*********************************************************/

new OktaSignIn(config).renderEl(  
  { el: '#sign-in-widget' },  
  function (res) {  
    console.log(res)  
  },  
  function (err) {  
    console.log(err)  
  }  
);
```

That's it! Pretty cool, huh?

The Okta Sign-In Widget has a lot of great configuration options, and you can check out the docs for them [on the GitHub page](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget).

## Try Out Your New Spring Boot App with Social Login

Sign out of the developer.okta.com dashboard, and restart your spring boot app using `./mvnw`.

Once the app has started, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and click the **Login** button.

You should see the new social login buttons and should be able to log in using Google and Facebook. 

**NOTE: If your social accounts use an email address different than what you're using for your Okta developer account, you may need to add a user to the Okta application.**
