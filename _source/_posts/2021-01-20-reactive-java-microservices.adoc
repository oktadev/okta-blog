Java has been at the forefront of https://www.okta.com/blog/2021/02/microservices/[microservice] architectures since they came to prominence a few years ago. It's a popular language with well-known, high-quality frameworks, like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Data, and Spring Security.

Spring Boot 2.0 introduced a new web framework called Spring WebFlux. Previous versions of Spring Boot only shipped with Spring MVC as an option. WebFlux offers a way for developers to do _reactive programming_. This means you can write your code with familiar syntax and, as a result, your app will use fewer resources and scale better.

== Why Reactive Java?

Reactive programming isn't for every app. The general rule of thumb is it won't help you if you have < 500 requests/second. Chances are Spring MVC will perform as well as Spring WebFlux up to that point. When your traffic takes off, or if you need to process things faster than 500 requests/second, you should take a look at Spring WebFlux.

Spring WebFlux's API has a similar syntax to Spring MVC. For example, here's the Spring MVC code for creating a new `Points` entity.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * {@code POST  /points} : Create a new points.
 *
 * @param points the points to create.
 * @return the {@link ResponseEntity} with status {@code 201 (Created)} and with body the new points, or with status {@code 400 (Bad Request)} if the points has already an ID.
 * @throws URISyntaxException if the Location URI syntax is incorrect.
 */
@PostMapping("/points")
public ResponseEntity<Points> createPoints(@Valid @RequestBody Points points) throws URISyntaxException {
    log.debug("REST request to save Points : {}", points);
    if (points.getId() != null) {
        throw new BadRequestAlertException("A new points cannot already have an ID", ENTITY_NAME, "idexists");
    }
    Points result = pointsRepository.save(points);
    pointsSearchRepository.save(result);
    return ResponseEntity
        .created(new URI("/api/points/" + result.getId()))
        .headers(HeaderUtil.createEntityCreationAlert(applicationName, true, ENTITY_NAME, result.getId().toString()))
        .body(result);
}
----

The same functionality when implemented with Spring WebFlux returns a `Mono` and uses a more functional, streaming style to avoid blocking.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * {@code POST  /points} : Create a new points.
 *
 * @param points the points to create.
 * @return the {@link ResponseEntity} with status {@code 201 (Created)} and with body the new points, or with status {@code 400 (Bad Request)} if the points has already an ID.
 * @throws URISyntaxException if the Location URI syntax is incorrect.
 */
@PostMapping("/points")
public Mono<ResponseEntity<Points>> createPoints(@Valid @RequestBody Points points) throws URISyntaxException {
    log.debug("REST request to save Points : {}", points);
    if (points.getId() != null) {
        throw new BadRequestAlertException("A new points cannot already have an ID", ENTITY_NAME, "idexists");
    }
    return pointsRepository
        .save(points)
        .flatMap(pointsSearchRepository::save)
        .map(
            result -> {
                try {
                    return ResponseEntity
                        .created(new URI("/api/points/" + result.getId()))
                        .headers(HeaderUtil.createEntityCreationAlert(applicationName, true, ENTITY_NAME, result.getId().toString()))
                        .body(result);
                } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
            }
        );
}

In this guide, I'll show you how to create a reactive microservices architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Cloud Config, Spring WebFlux, Java, and JHipster.

== Build a Reactive Java Microservices Architecture

https://jhipster.tech[JHipster] is an open-source project that started as an application generator, based on https://yeoman.io[Yeoman]. It's also the https://yeoman.io/generators/[most popular Yeoman generator]. JHipster initially allowed you to generate AngularJS and Spring apps. In the last five years, it's become a platform with extensibility, grown a thriving community, and has saved developers many hours of pain and frustration.

You see, JHipster integrates everything for you. Do you want to use Angular with Spring Boot? It's got that. React? Yep. Microservices with Spring Cloud? Check!

JHipster 7 was recently released, and it packs a punch! A couple of slick features that I like are Vue support and reactive microservices with Spring WebFlux. To be fair, WebFlux and Spring Cloud Gateway have been an option since JHipster https://www.jhipster.tech/2020/03/08/jhipster-release-6.8.0.html[6.8.0 in March 2020], but now we have R2DBC support too!

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to generate a microservice architecture that uses OAuth 2.0, an API gateway, and two microservices (a blog and a store). The gateway will use PostgreSQL with R2DBC, the blog will use Neo4j, and the store will use MongoDB. All persistence options are powered by Spring Data.

Start by installing JHipster using npm:

[source,shell]
----
npm i -g generator-jhipster@7.0.1
----

After installing JHipster, you can run the following command to answer a whole slew of questions and create an app.

[source,shell]
----
jhipster
----

image::{% asset_path 'blog/reactive-java-microservices/jhipster-command.png' %}[alt=JHipster prompts,width=800,align=center]

However, there's an easier way. JHipster has its own domain language!

== Define Your Reactive Java Architecture with JDL

JHipster Domain Language (https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/[JDL]) offers a way to define apps, so you don't have to worry about fat-fingering your answer to the `jhipster` command's questions.

TIP: You can also generate your JHipster apps using https://start.jhipster.tech[JHipster Online]. However, it's a bit tedious when creating a microservice architecture.

Create a new directory on your machine and navigate into it in your terminal.

[source,shell]
----
take reactive-stack # mkdir reactive-stack && cd reactive-stack
git init # initialize git, so apps aren't created with their own .git
----

Copy the JDL below and put it into a `reactive-ms.jdl` file.

====
----
application {
  config {
    baseName gateway // <1>
    reactive true // <2>
    packageName com.okta.developer.gateway
    applicationType gateway
    authenticationType oauth2 // <3>
    buildTool gradle // <4>

  date Instant required
}

entity Tag {

}

entity Product {
  title String required
  price BigDecimal required min(0)
  image ImageBlob
}

relationship ManyToOne {
  Blog{user(login)} to User
  Post{blog(name)} to Blog
}

relationship ManyToMany {
  Post{tag(name)} to Tag{post}
}

paginate Post, Tag with infinite-scroll
paginate Product with pagination

microservice Product with store
microservice Blog, Post, Tag with blog

deployment { // <8>
  deploymentType docker-compose
  appsFolders [gateway, blog, store]
  dockerRepositoryName "mraible"
}
----
<.> The first app is an API gateway.
<.> Because the gateway is reactive, it'll use Spring Cloud Gateway.
<.> The gateway and microservice apps must use the same authentication type.
<.> Use Gradle, because a lot of y'all love it.
<.> Vue support is new in JHipster 7, let's use it!
<.> JHipster 7 supports Cypress! It seems to be more reliable than Protractor.
<.> Make sure and specify `microservice` as the application type for the blog and store apps.
<.> JDL allows you to create Docker Compose and Kubernetes deployments too!
====

TIP: See https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/applications#available-application-configuration-options[application configuration options] to see the possible values for the above configuration options.

Import this architecture definition and generate `gateway`, `blog`, and `store` apps.

[source,shell]
----
jhipster jdl reactive-ms.jdl
----

As part of this process, several Docker Compose files are generated for you. These allow you to run databases, the https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/[JHipster Registry] (for service discovery), https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] (for identity), all with Docker.

== Run Your Reactive Java Microservices

After JHipster finishes generating your apps, you can run them with Gradle. Assuming you're in the same top-level directories you ran `jhipster jdl` from, you can run the following commands to start all the backend services for each microservice.

TIP: JHipster has a https://www.jhipster.tech/oh-my-zsh/[Oh My ZSH! plugin] that I highly recommend. It provides aliases for starting Docker containers and is a real time-saver. I've included these commands as comments below.

[source,shell]
----
cd gateway
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d #jhkeycloakup
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d #jhpostgresqlup
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d #jhregistryup
./gradlew
----

NOTE: You can run `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml logs --follow` to watch the logs of the JHipster Registry (or `jhregistrylogs` if you're using Oh My Zsh and have the JHipster plugin installed).

The https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/[JHipster Registry] is a Netflix Eureka server that handles service discovery. When the gateway and microservices start up, they register with Eureka. This allows communication between services using logical names, rather than IP address or host names. JHipster Registry also contains a Spring Cloud Config server that can distribute configuration between apps. You can learn more about Spring Cloud Config in link:/blog/2020/12/07/spring-cloud-config[Spring Cloud Config for Shared Microservice Configuration].

Open a new terminal window, start the blog app's Neo4j database, and then the app itself.

[source,shell]
----
cd ../blog
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/neo4j.yml up -d #jhneo4jup
./gradlew
----

Then, open another terminal window, start the store app's MongoDB database, and the microservice.

[source,shell]
----
cd ../store
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d #jhmongoup
./gradlew
----

[CAUTION]
====
To make Keycloak work, you need to add the following line to your hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Mac/Linux, `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows).

----
127.0.0.1	keycloak
----

This is because you will access your application with a browser on your machine (which is named localhost, or `127.0.0.1`), but inside Docker, it will run in its own container, which is named `keycloak`.
====

== Test Your Reactive Java Microservices

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your favorite browser. You should be able to login with `admin/admin` as credentials.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/reactive-java-microservices/keycloak-login.png' %}[alt=Keycloak login,width=800,align=center]

image::{% asset_path 'blog/reactive-java-microservices/keycloak-login-success.png' %}[alt=Keycloak login success,width=800,align=center]

Make sure you can add a new blog, edit existing posts, and add new products.

To prove everything works in an automated fashion, you can run `npm run e2e` in the gateway project's directory. This will run a number of end-to-end tests with https://www.cypress.io/[Cypress].

image::{% asset_path 'blog/reactive-java-microservices/e2e-success.png' %}[alt=Protractor tests success,width=800,align=center]

== Prepare Your Reactive Java Stack for Production

Keycloak is a superb open source identity provider. It has excellent support for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) and easily runs in a Docker container. I greatly appreciate Keycloak's ease-of-use. I also appreciate Spring Security's OAuth and OIDC support.

Spring Security makes it so you only need to override three properties to switch from Keycloak to Okta!

In production, you might not want to manage your own identity provider instance. That's where Okta comes in. We're a developer-friendly SaaS company that provides OAuth and OIDC support as a service.

{% include setup/cli.md type="jhipster" %}

=== Update the JHipster Registry to Distribute OIDC Configuration

I mentioned earlier that Spring Cloud Config allows you to distribute Spring's configuration between apps. In this section, you'll configure JHipster's Spring Security settings to use Okta across all your services.

Add the following YAML to `gateway/src/main/docker/central-server-config/localhost-config/application.yml`. You can find the values for each property in the `.okta.env` file.

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://<your-okta-domain>/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: <client-id>
            client-secret: <client-secret>
----

Save your changes. These values will be distributed to the JHipster Registry, gateway, blog, and store apps. Restart the JHipster Registry by running the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml down #jhregistrydown
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d #jhregistryup
----

Use kbd:[Ctrl + C] to kill all your `./gradlew` processes and start them again.

Now, open a new incognito browser window, go to `http://localhost:8080`, and sign in. Rejoice that using Okta for authentication works!

image::{% asset_path 'blog/reactive-java-microservices/okta-login.png' %}[alt=Okta login,width=800,align=center]

image::{% asset_path 'blog/reactive-java-microservices/okta-login-success.png' %}[alt=Okta login success,width=800,align=center]

If you're feeling lucky, you can set your Okta credentials as environment variables and run end-to-end tests (from the `gateway` directory).

[source,shell]
----
export CYPRESS_E2E_USERNAME=<your-username>
export CYPRESS_E2E_PASSWORD=<your-password>
npm run e2e
----

== Create Docker Images for Your Microservice Apps

The JDL you used to create this reactive stack contains Docker configuration, so you can run everything with Docker Compose.

Stop all your apps with kbd:[Ctrl + C]. Stop all your Docker instances too.

[source,shell]
----
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
----

TIP: Bump up the memory and CPU that Docker uses in Docker > Preferences > Resources. I have my Docker preferences set to 6 CPUs and 12GB of RAM.

To run your reactive stack with Docker Compose, you need to create Docker images for each app. In your three different app directories, run the following Gradle command:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew -Pprod bootJar jibDockerBuild
----

== Run Your Microservices Stack with Docker Compose

Once your Docker containers are finished building, you'll want to add your Okta settings to Spring Cloud Config in JHipster Registry.

=== Switch Identity Providers with Spring Cloud Config

Open `docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` in your favorite IDE (I like link:/blog/2020/10/26/java-intellij-idea[IntelliJ IDEA]) and remove the Keycloak image at the bottom. You can leave it if you like, but it won't be used in this example.

Update `docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml` to contain your OIDC settings that you want to share with all your microservices.

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://<your-okta-domain>/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: <client-id>
            client-secret: <client-secret>
----

=== Prove Your Reactive Java Stack Works

Before you start everything with Docker, make sure you have adequate resources configured. The default is 2GB of memory and at least 6GB is recommended. Go to **Docker Desktop** > **Preferences** > **Resources** to configure. You can see my settings in the screenshot below.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/reactive-java-microservices/docker-preferences.png' %}[alt=Docker Preferences,width=700,align=center]

In the `docker-compose` directory, run the following command to start all your containers.

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose up
----

TIP: You can add a `-d` to the above command to run it as a daemon. I like watching all the log messages dance with each other.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/reactive-java-microservices/jhipster-colors.png' %}[alt=JHipster colors,width=800,align=center]

You should be able to open `http://localhost:8080`, sign in, and access all of your microservices. Pretty slick, eh?! 🤓

== What About Kotlin Microservices?

JHipster supports Kotlin-based microservices thanks to its https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin[Kotlin blueprint], supported by https://github.com/sendilkumarn[Sendil Kumar N].

You can install it using npm:

[source,shell]
----
npm install -g generator-jhipster-kotlin
----

Then, use `khipster jdl reactive-ms` to create the same stack you did above with Kotlin.

NOTE: At the time of this writing, JHipster's Kotlin blueprint doesn't support JHipster 7. Watch the https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin/releases[project's releases page] for updates.

== How Do I Deploy to the Cloud?

JHipster creates a cloud-native microservices architecture that can be deployed to many cloud providers. There's specific support for AWS, Microsoft Azure, Heroku, and Google Cloud Platform.

However, if you're doing microservices, you'll probably want to leverage Docker as you did in this tutorial. When your apps are containerized, they can be orchestrated with Kubernetes.

JHipster has a https://www.jhipster.tech/kubernetes/[Kubernetes] sub-generator that you can use to deploy it to the cloud. I'll cover this in a future tutorial.

In the meantime, you can watch a presentation that https://twitter.com/saturnism[Ray Tsang] and I did recently that shows how to deploy JHipster microservices with Kubernetes. If you start watching from https://youtu.be/AG4z18qePEw?t=2778[46:18], you'll see Ray show how to deploy to Google Cloud using Kubernetes.

</div>

== Should You Go Reactive?

As with most software architecture decisions, it depends. Are you building CRUD apps? Then no, Spring MVC is good enough.

Are you dealing with massive amounts of steaming data and millions of customers? Then yes, reactive frameworks like Spring WebFlux might just save you $$$ on your monthly cloud bill.

What about https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/loom/Main[Project Loom]? Will it allow you to write regular non-reactive code that performs as good as reactive frameworks? I'm not sure. I'm betting on reactive for now. I think it's a good skill to have for Java developers.

If you want to learn more about Project Loom, I recommend listening to https://inside.java/2020/11/24/podcast-008/[Episode 8 "Project Loom" with Ron Pressler] from the https://inside.java/podcast/[Inside Java Podcast].

== Learn More About Reactive Java and Microservices

This tutorial isn't an in-depth guide to programming reactive Java microservices. That's because it doesn't have to be! With JHipster, you can generate high-quality reactive Java code (~70% test coverage) that's based on fantastic frameworks like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring WebFlux, and Spring Security.

JHipster also implements most of the patterns in my link:/blog/2020/03/23/microservice-security-patterns[Security Patterns for Microservice Architectures]. You can add dependency scanning with Snyk (based on https://snyk.io/blog/jhipster-security-scanning/[Brian Vermeer's blog post]), use HTTPS locally, adopt OAuth, add CI/CD, and generate secure Docker containers, just to name a few.

The Spring Cloud Gateway implementation in JHipster is largely based on what I learned when researching and writing link:/blog/2019/08/28/reactive-microservices-spring-cloud-gateway[Secure Reactive Microservices with Spring Cloud Gateway]. Spring Cloud Gateway makes it trivial to relay an access token between a gateway and microservices. It's just five lines of YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      default-filters:
        - TokenRelay
----

You can find the completed source code for this example on GitHub, in the https://github.com/oktadev/java-microservices-examples/tree/main/reactive-jhipster[oktadev/java-microservices-examples repository].

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/oktadev/java-microservices-examples.git
cd java-microservices-examples/reactive-jhipster
