Sails.js is an exciting MVC framework for Node.js. Recently the team released version 1.0 and today you're going to learn how to use the framework to rapidly build a new website. The hype around Sails.js is real. As a veteran MVC developer, I was impressed with the extensibility, organization, flow, and speed Sails.js provides.

The team at Sails. js has done an excellent job of abstracting the MVC portion of the codebase away from the ancillary tasks of database management, authentication, authorization, setting up middleware, and anything else you can imagine. Once your project is set up the way you see fit, the MVC portion of the project is very quick. In this tutorial, I won't be going over everything in the setup because Sails.js supports almost any tools you use. Once you start work on your project, you'll want to go through and understand how best to meet your needs. I highly recommend going over the [Concepts Section](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts) on Sails' website for more information.

One last note about Sails.js in general; the framework really shines with a project that is well thought through and ready for development. If you start working on a project and continuously flip between the policies, routes, models, views, and controllers the framework can get a little overwhelming. It's much easier to have the list of routes already designed before implementing the code then moving on to the controllers and so forth.

In this project, you will build a small web application for monitoring and maintaining a garden. Recently, I completed an enclosed garden for my wife and grew interested in monitoring and maintaining it remotely using an Arduino. The system will have a controller for a fountain, a GSM module for communicating with this web application, and an array of peripherals for monitoring the general health of the garden. This application will be used to store and display the metrics on the garden's health as well as take instructions for turning the fountain on and off.

## Setup Okta

First, you need to set up a new application in Okta. Log into your developer console and click on **Applications** and then **Add Application**. Okta will ask you to choose your platform which you can select **Web**. This will bring you to the _Application Settings_ section of the setup phase. Name your application something meaningful, I named mine _Gardino_. You will likely need to change the ports on your _Base URIs_, _Login redirects URIs_, and _Logout redirect URIs_. By default, Sails.js uses _1337_ so change _8080_ to _1337_.

{% img blog/quickly-build-apps-with-sailsjs/application-settings.jpg alt:"Application settings" width:"773" %}{: .center-image }

Press **Done** and you'll be able to review your setup before moving forward. Make note of your _ClientId_ and your _Client Secret_ as you will need these for your application.

## Create Your Sails.js Application

With your Okta application complete you can start building your application. First, you will need to install Sails. js globally using npm.

```sh
npm install sails -g
```

Next, you can use the Sails generator in your directory to create a new app.

```sh
sails new gardunio
```

You will be shown a prompt asking if you want to create a _Web App_ or _Empty_ project. Choose the Web App option.

{% img blog/quickly-build-apps-with-sailsjs/choose-a-template.jpg alt:"Choose a template" width:"762" %}{: .center-image }

The Web App option will automatically load some dependencies that are pretty useful out of the box. These include `bootstrap`, `vue`, and `parasails`. Parasails is a small wrapper around Vue.js and Lodash that is useful if you choose to use Vue.js on your front end.

The downside of this approach is it will create a whole web app with pages and models that you don't need. You can remedy this by removing some of the irrelevant files. First, delete the `views/emails`. Next, delete `views/layouts/layout-email.ejs` . Finally, you can delete everything in the `views/pages` folder except `homepage.ejs`.

Next, in the `api` folder you should delete the `hooks` folder. You can delete the contents of `api/controllers` , `api/models` , and `api/helpers` . Finally, delete `api/responses/expired.js` and `api/policies/is-super-admin.js`.

Last, you will want to delete the contents of the `assets/js` folder. You may be wondering why you deleted all those files rather than using the _Empty_ option. It's a matter of deleting some extraneous things, vs going through the work of adding in missing but critical components to the application. It's a little bit easier to remove the web app features than add back the missing components.

### Install Application Dependencies

Because the web app version of the sails.js generator comes pretty near ready to go, the packages you need to install are minimal. You will need the Okta Middleware for managing your authentication. You will also want to get _dotenv_ for housing your environment variables.

```console
npm i @okta/oidc-middleware@4.0.1
npm i @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs@3.2.0
npm i dotenv@8.2
```

Once these are installed, add a file called `.env` to your root folder and add the following values. The `OKTA_ORG_URL` will be the same as the URL you used to login into your developer's console. In the instance below, that would be `https://dev-1234124.okta.com`. The `OKTA_CLIENT_ID` and `OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET` you should have retrieved from the developer's console when setting up your Okta application.

{% img blog/quickly-build-apps-with-sailsjs/okta-login.png alt:"Okta login" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

```javascript
APP_BASE_URL = http://localhost:1337
OKTA_ORG_URL = {yourOktaOrgUrl}
OKTA_CLIENT_ID = {yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET = {yourClientSecret}
```

### Configure Your Sails.js Application

Now, you can start to configure your application. As mentioned before, this is where most of your code not related to the application workflow itself is.

With the `.env` file set up and your Okta application configured, you can configure the Okta middleware to help handle your authentication. To do so you will need to configure the Okta middleware, `express-session`, and define the order in which the middleware will be executed. This work takes place in the `config/http.js` file.

```javascript
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports.http = {
  middleware: {
    order: [
      "cookieParser",
      "session",
      "bodyParser",
      "compress",
      "poweredBy",
      "router",
      "www",
      "favicon",
      "expresssession",
      "oktaInit",
    ],

    expresssession: (function () {
      var session = require("express-session");
      return session({
        secret: "some*crazy*long*random*string",
        resave: true,
        saveUninitialized: false,
      });
    })(),

    oktaInit: (function () {
      var ExpressOIDC = require("@okta/oidc-middleware").ExpressOIDC;

      var oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
        issuer: process.env.OKTA_ORG_URL + "/oauth2/default",
        client_id: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET,
        appBaseUrl: process.env.APP_BASE_URL,
        scope: "openid profile",
        routes: {
          login: {
            path: "/login",
          },
          loginCallback: {
            path: "/authorization-code/callback",
            afterCallback: "/Dashboard",
          },
        },
      });

      return oidc.router;
    })(),
  },
};
```

### Configure Sails.js Routes and Policies

Next, you will define your routes as well as the policies associated with them. Routing in Sails.js is very flexible and powerful. . A full explanation of routing features and options is out of the scope of this tutorial, but you should know routing in Sails.js is very flexible and powerful. Replace `config/routes.js` with the following code.

```javascript
module.exports.routes = {
  "/": { view: "pages/homepage" },

  "GET /dashboard": { action: "dashboard/index" },
  "GET /history": { action: "history/index" },

  "POST /users/logout": { action: "users/logout" },
  "POST /device/toggle-fountain": { action: "device/toggle-fountain" },
};
```

Here you are registering 5 routes. The first is the index page which will return a view called `pages/homepage`. You haven't created this view yet but you will shortly. The homepage is a static HTML page, so there is no need to bind the route to an action. The home page will simply serve as a landing page with a login button.

The remaining two pages, however, require a model in order to render them, so you will need to connect those to an action. First, you have a dashboard page which will show the current conditions of the garden itself. The second is a history page which will show you the trends of your garden's health.

Finally, you have 2 post routes; one logs out the user and the other is for toggling the fountain on or off.

You don't want unauthorized users coming in and viewing your garden's status or controlling your water fountain so you'll need to add some authentication to the routes you want to protect. For this project, you will put all of your routes—except the homepage—under authentication. To do so, you will define policies in your `config/policies.js` file.

```javascript
module.exports.policies = {
  "*": "is-logged-in",
  "/": true,
};
```

Your policies are fairly straightforward. All pages will look to `is-logged-in` to determine if the user is logged in. That is overridden for the `'/'` path. Setting the `'/'` path to `true` means that the page allows public access.

Finally, you need to implement the `is-logged-in` policy module. Open the `api/policies/is-logged-in.js` file. If you have deleted this file, create a new one named `is-logged-in.js` under `api/policies`. Replace the contents of this file with the following code.

```javascript
module.exports = async function (req, res, proceed) {
  if (req.session.passport) {
    return proceed();
  }

  // Otherwise, this request did not come from a logged-in user.
  return res.unauthorized();
};
```

When the user logs in using Okta, the value of that user will be stored in the `passport` session object. You can check the request's session object for the passport. If it is there, the user is logged in and you can use that object to collect data about the user if required. If the passport is missing the user isn't logged in and you return an `unauthorized` response. The unauthorized response is defined in `api/responses/unauthorized.js`.

```javascript
module.exports = function unauthorized() {
  var req = this.req;
  var res = this.res;

  sails.log.verbose("Ran custom response: res.unauthorized()");

  if (req.wantsJSON) {
    return res.sendStatus(401);
  }
  // Or log them out (if necessary) and then redirect to the login page.
  else {
    if (req.session.userId) {
      delete req.session.userId;
    }

    return res.redirect("/login");
  }
};
```

The code automatically generated by Sails.js checks if the request wants a JSON response. If that's the case, this function will return a `401` to the client indicating the user isn't logged in. If it is requesting a page, the current user is removed from the session and is redirected to the `login` route. The login route is defined in the `http.js` file as the login page for Okta. Therefore, routing the user to the login page will send them to Okta to sign in. After a successful login, the user is redirected to the **Dashboard** page.

### Bootstrap Your Sails.js App

By default, Sails.js reads and writes data to a local disk, which is perfect for prototyping your application. Although this tutorial does not use an external database, it's good to know the `config/datastores.js` file is used to configure your backend database of choice. The built-in ORM will perform CRUD operations against your datastore while being agnostic to whatever underlying storage you use. For example, you can configure your test environment using local storage, a staging environment using MySql, and a production environment using PostgreSQL. The application will switch seamlessly between the three without affecting the rest of your application's code.

Your application needs some initial data for testing. At application startup, Sails.js executes the `config/bootstrap.js` module, making it an ideal place to inject seed data. Replace the contents of `config/bootstrap.js` with the following code.

```javascript
module.exports.bootstrap = async function () {
  var date = Date.now();

  await GardenData.createEach([
    {
      readingDateTime: date,
      temperature: 75,
      moistureContent: 15,
      sunlight: 80,
      ph: 7.8,
      storedWater: 14,
      fountainStatus: false,
    },
    {
      readingDateTime: date - 60 * 1000,
      temperature: 74,
      moistureContent: 15.2,
      sunlight: 80,
      ph: 7.8,
      storedWater: 14,
      fountainStatus: false,
    },
    {
      readingDateTime: date - 2 * 60 * 1000,
      temperature: 74,
      moistureContent: 15.6,
      sunlight: 80,
      ph: 7.8,
      storedWater: 14,
      fountainStatus: false,
    },
    {
      readingDateTime: date - 3 * 60 * 1000,
      temperature: 73,
      moistureContent: 16,
      sunlight: 80,
      ph: 7.5,
      storedWater: 14.5,
      fountainStatus: true,
    },
    {
      readingDateTime: date - 4 * 60 * 1000,
      temperature: 73,
      moistureContent: 16.5,
      sunlight: 80,
      ph: 7.5,
      storedWater: 15,
      fountainStatus: true,
    },
    {
      readingDateTime: date - 5 * 60 * 1000,
      temperature: 73,
      moistureContent: 17,
      sunlight: 80,
      ph: 7.5,
      storedWater: 15.5,
      fountainStatus: false,
    },
  ]);
};
```

This is populating basic information into your database by mocking up some test readings that may have taken place over the last 5 minutes. This is the first time you will see the query language used by Sails.js. It is fairly intuitive and, if you're a veteran node developer, most of it will look very familiar to you. The `createEach` function takes an array of `GardenData` and adds it to your local store. After lifting the application you will be able to see this data in the `.tmp/localDiskDb/gardendata.db` file.

### Add Models to Your Sails.js App

Before you lift the application, however, you need to define the `GardenData` model. You should put your models in the `api/models` folder that Sails generated for you.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  attributes: {
    id: {
      type: "number",
      autoIncrement: true,
    },

    readingDateTime: {
      type: "number",
      autoCreatedAt: true,
    },

    temperature: {
      type: "number",
    },

    moistureContent: {
      type: "number",
    },

    sunlight: {
      type: "number",
    },

    ph: {
      type: "number",
    },

    storedWater: {
      type: "number",
    },

    fountainStatus: {
      type: "boolean",
    },
  },
};
```

Here is where you define the columns on your table with their types and any attributes they carry. In this case, you told `id` to auto increment. By default, Sails.js will consider `id` to be the primary key. The `readingDateTime` field will also automatically be populated with the created DateTime of the row.

You also want to define a `FountainRequest` model in the `api/models` folder. This model is what the controller at the garden will read to check if it should turn the fountain on or off. The web application will have a toggle switch on it to call your `device/toggle-fountain` action which will add a new record to this table.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  attributes: {
    id: {
      type: "number",
      autoIncrement: true,
    },

    dateTime: {
      type: "number",
      autoCreatedAt: true,
    },

    toggle: {
      type: "boolean",
    },

    respondedTo: {
      type: "boolean",
    },

    respondedAt: {
      type: "number",
      autoUpdatedAt: true,
    },
  },
};
```

The key is knowing when the request has been handled. If there are multiple unhandled requests, the application should only send the latest and mark all as `respondedTo`. But, using the `autoUpdatedAt` attribute on `respondedAt`, will automatically populate the `respondedAt` field when you have updated `respondedTo`.

### Add Controllers to Your Sails.js App

If you're familiar with MVC you are probably used to having a controller file with a list of actions in it. Sails.js recommends keeping each action in its own file and using the folder structure to define the controller. This is the approach you will take here. Start by adding 4 new folders to the `api/controllers` folder; `dashboard` , `device` , `history` , and `users` .

In the `dashboard` folder, add a file named`index.js`. As you may have guessed, this folder structure and file name together will define the route `dashboard/index`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  friendlyName: "Dashboard",

  description: "Displays the Garduino Dashboard",

  exits: {
    success: {
      viewTemplatePath: "pages/dashboard",
    },
  },

  fn: async function () {
    var data = await GardenData.find({
      where: {},
      sort: [
        {
          readingDateTime: "DESC",
        },
      ],
      limit: 1,
    });

    return {
      currentData: data[0],
    };
  },
};
```

This is the real beauty of Sails.js. Controllers are small and concise and don't rely on any code that isn't directly related to rendering and serving the view. A controller returns an object with a few properties and a function. The `fn` function is used to build and return a model. The `exits` property defines what to do with the model—such as a view to render.

In `dashboard/index.js`, the `fn` function uses the Sails.js ORM (currently configured for local file storage) to retrieve the latest `GardenData` reading. The `exits` property instructs Sails.js to render the `pages/dashboard` view using the given model.

Next, you can add the `index.js` file to the `history` folder and add the following code.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  friendlyName: "History",

  description: "Displays the Garduino History for the last Month",

  exits: {
    success: {
      viewTemplatePath: "pages/history",
    },
  },

  fn: async function () {
    var data = await GardenData.find({});
    return {
      gardenData: data,
    };
  },
};
```

Again, you are just returning some `GardenData` but this time you are getting all of the garden's history. If you need to apply pagination, you can always use the `skip` and `limit` arguments to only send down a few of the entries at once.

Add a file for the `logout.js` action under the `users` folder. This will log the user out and redirect them to the home page.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  friendlyName: "Logout",

  description: "Logs the User Out",

  exits: {},

  fn: async function () {
    this.req.session.destroy(function () {});
    this.res.clearCookie("connect.sid");
    this.res.redirect("/");
  },
};
```

Finally, under the `device` folder, create a file named `toggle-fountain.js`. This action will add an entry that will tell the fountain to turn off or on. The controller returns JSON data with a `success` flag.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  friendlyName: "Toggle Fountain",

  description: "Logs a request for the Fountain to be turned on",

  exits: {},

  fn: async function () {
    var on = this.req.body.on == "true";

    await FountainRequest.create({
      respondedTo: false,
      toggle: on,
    });

    return this.res.json({ success: true });
  },
};
```

### Add Views to Your Sails.js App

With all the server work done, it's time to add the views. First, you should edit your layout view. In the `layouts` folder edit (or add) the `layout.ejs` file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Garudino - A Place to Manage your Garden</title>

    <!-- Viewport mobile tag for sensible mobile support -->
    <meta

            <% } %>
          </ul>

          <%if (!req.session.passport) { %>
          <div>
            <a class="btn btn-outline-success my-2 my-sm-0" href="/login"
              >Login</a

          <% } else { %>
          <div>
            <form action="users/logout" method="POST">
              <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="<%= _csrf %>" />
              <button
                class="btn btn-outline-success my-2 my-sm-0"
                type="submit"
              >
                Logout
              </button>
            </form>
          </div>
          <% } %>
        </div>
      </nav>

</html>
```

There isn't anything too groundbreaking on the view side. As this application is set up, you can use EJS or Vue to render your views. There is a `login`/`logout` button that detects if the user is logged in and some menu options that you hide from the user until they log in. You'll also notice the `<%- body %>` tag that renders the body from the individual views.

Next is the home page. In your `pages` folder edit or add `homepage.ejs`.

```html
<div class="jumbotron">

  <h3>Garduino</h4>
  <h4><i>Manage and Monitor your Garden Remotely</i></h4>

</div>

<div class="card">
<div class="card-header">
  Login In
</div>

<div class="card-body">

  <a class="btn btn-primary" href="/login">Using Okta</a>
</div>

</div>
```

You are providing the Login button for users as well as a small landing page.

Next, you can add `history.ejs` to your `pages` folder.

{%raw%}
```html
<div id="history">
  <h3>Historical Readings</h3>

  <hr />

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Date/Time</th>
            <th>Temperature</th>

<%- exposeLocalsToBrowser() %>
```
{%endraw%}

In this section, you present a table to the user with the gardenData information. Take note of the `<%- exposeLocalsToBrowser() %>` piece of code. This is provided by sails.js and provides a number of features. First, it will make your model available using `window.SAILS_LOCALS`. Second,it provides some protection against Cross-Site Scripting attacks by escaping untrusted data.

Where can you use `window.SAILS_LOCALS`? In the javascript page that is bound to this view. Under `assets/js`, add a new folder for `pages`. In that folder add a new javascript file called `history.page.js` and add the code below.

```javascript
parasails.registerPage("history", {
  data: {
    gardenData: undefined,
  },

  beforeMount: function () {
    // Attach any initial data from the server.
    _.extend(this, window.SAILS_LOCALS);
  },

  methods: {},
});
```

This is where you will find all your client-side javascript for this page. Parasails uses `registerPage` to bind the javascript to the `history` section of your document. In order for your document to use it, you need to wrap your HTML/ejs/vue markup under a root `div` node with id `history`. Parasails will find the `history` div and bind this javascript to it. Then, you can attach the initial data from the server using `_extend(this, window.SAILS_LOCALS)` and make it ready to use for your view. Here, you've defined your data as `gardenData` and bound it to the `gardenData` that was returned from the action. Because this page doesn't have much in the way of functionality there aren't any methods here, but you can see on the `dashboard` page how those are used.

Add a new file under `views/pages` called `dashboard.ejs` and add the following code.

<%- exposeLocalsToBrowser() %>

  /* Hide default HTML checkbox */
  .switch input {
    opacity: 0;
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
  }

  /* The slider */
  .slider {
    position: absolute;
    cursor: pointer;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;

    border-radius: 34px;
  }

  .slider.round:before {
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
</style>
```
{%endraw%}

Next, under `assets/js/pages` add a new file for `dashboard.page.js` and add this code.

```javascript
parasails.registerPage("dashboard", {
  data: {
    currentData: undefined,
  },

  beforeMount: function () {
    // Attach any initial data from the server.
    _.extend(this, window.SAILS_LOCALS);
  },

  methods: {
    toggleFountain: function (e) {
      $.post("device/toggle-fountain", {
        on: e.target.checked,
        _csrf: window.SAILS_LOCALS._csrf,
      });
    },
  },
});
```

As you can see, you are giving a method for `toggleFountain` that will make a call back to the server to input a new record.

### Run your Application

Finally, you're ready to start your application. From the terminal run `sails lift` and use a browser to navigate to localhost:1337.
