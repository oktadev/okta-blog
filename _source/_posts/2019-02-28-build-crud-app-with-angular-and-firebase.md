Storage as a Service (SaaS) is becoming ever more popular with many businesses. The advantages are clear. Instead of maintaining your own backend server you can outsource the service to a different provider. This can result in a significant increase in productivity, as well as a reduction in development and maintenance costs. In addition, the worry about server security is offloaded to the storage provider. SaaS is an option whenever the server part of your application can be reduced to storage of object data, optionally with access control. There are a number of different SaaS providers available. Arguably, one of the biggest players in the field is Google with the Firebase service.

In this tutorial, I will be showing you how to create your own Wiki using Angular for the frontend client and Firebase for storing the Wiki documents. You'll see that it's easy to create a complete application in minutes.

## Set Up the Firebase Database

Firebase offers different methods for storing data. I will be using the new Firestore service instead of the more established Real-time Database. Firestore allows you to set up a more structured database together with a more powerful query API. To get started, open your browser and navigate to the Firebase console at `https://console.firebase.google.com/`. Log in using your Google account and accept all terms and conditions. In the Firebase console, you can see an overview of all your projects.

If you haven't worked with Firebase before you'll need to create your first Project. Click on the card with the plus sign that says **Add project**. In the pop-up that appears you can edit the project name and settings. Change the name to anything you like, accept the terms and conditions, and leave everything else at its default.

{% img blog/firebase-angular-wiki/firebase-step01.png alt:"Firebase: Add a Project" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

When you submit the form you are taken to the **Project Overview** page. Make a note of the Firebase project URL. You will need it, later on, to set up the client. The first thing that you will have to do here is to create a new database. Select **Database** in the left sidebar menu. You are given the choice between different technologies for storing your data. I will be using Firestore which allows you to store data in hierarchical format. At the time of writing, the Firestore database is advertised in the large banner at the top of the page. Click **Create Database** to create a Firestore database.  

{% img blog/firebase-angular-wiki/firebase-step02.png alt:"Firebase: Security rules" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Another pop-up dialog appears that lets you change the settings of the database. Select **Start in test mode** to allows any developer to access the database. Click **Enable** and you will be taken to a dialog that allows you to manually add the first data record to the database. Firestore does not allow a completely empty database so you will have to add some data here.

First, create a new collection called `pages`. This collection will contain all the wiki pages of your app. Then add a new document consisting of the following fields.

Field Name | Type
---------- | ----------
`content`  | text
`created`  | timestamp
`modified` | timestamp

The first document that you create will be your wiki's home page. Enter `home` for the document ID. This is the string that uniquely identifies your page. Then write any text into the `content` field. I will show you how to integrate markdown into your wiki, so you can enter any markdown string here. Next, enter the current date and time into the `created` and `modified` fields. Finally, click **Save** to save the document. You have now successfully set up your Firebase storage.

Next, you will need to obtain the information for using the service in your application. In the Firebase console click on the gear icon next to **Project Overview** to open the project settings. In the **General** tab scroll down to the bottom. You will see a notice telling you that there are no apps in your project. You will not be adding an app here but you can get the information by clicking on the web icon "</>". A pop-up appears with your API key, database URL etc. Copy the information to a safe place, you will need it later.

## Add User Authentication to Your Angular + Firebase App

The client will be implemented with user authentication from Okta. 

{% include setup/cli.md type="spa" framework="Angular"
   loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:4200/callback"
   logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:4200" %}

## Set Up Your Angular Client

The client will be implemented using Angular which is based Node. I will assume that you have installed Node and the `npm` command on your system. Angular uses a command line client, called `ng`, to automate many development tasks. If you haven't done so already, open a terminal and install it globally using `npm`.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@7.3.3
```

If you are on a system that doesn't let you modify system files as a normal user, you will have to run this command using `sudo`. You are now ready to create your application. In the terminal, navigate to a directory of your choice and create the wiki client.

```bash
ng new WikiClient --routing --style=css
```

This will create a directory with the name `WikiClient`, add some barebones application code in it, and install all necessary packages. Before you make any changes to your code, you can use the Angular schematic provided by Okta to set up authentication. Navigate into the `WikiClient` directory and run the following command.

```bash
ng add @oktadev/schematics
```

You will be asked about the issuer URL and the client ID of your application. To set them, simply copy and paste the values obtained from the Okta CLI. The command will add the latest Okta packages for Angular and set up the basic configuration to use Okta authentication in your application.

## Add Visual Design to Your Angular + Firebase Application

When implementing responsive front end user interfaces, I really enjoy working with the Zurb Foundation framework. It is a comprehensive set of CSS classes and JavaScript tools that has a huge amount of settings and can be styled according to your needs. For this tutorial, you'll only be using the CSS part of the framework which can be imported from the CDN. Add the following line into the `<head>` tag of `src/index.html`.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites@6.5.3/dist/css/foundation.min.css" integrity="sha256-xpOKVlYXzQ3P03j397+jWFZLMBXLES3IiryeClgU5og= sha384-gP4DhqyoT9b1vaikoHi9XQ8If7UNLO73JFOOlQV1RATrA7D0O7TjJZifac6NwPps sha512-AKwIib1E+xDeXe0tCgbc9uSvPwVYl6Awj7xl0FoaPFostZHOuDQ1abnDNCYtxL/HWEnVOMrFyf91TDgLPi9pNg==" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

Next, open up `src/styles.css` and replace the contents with some basic styling.

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

h1, h2 {
  text-align: center;
}
```

You will need to import some modules which you will be using later on and make them available for your application. Open up `src/app/app.module.ts` and add the following imports to the top of the file.

```ts
import { FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
```

Then add them to the list of imports further down in the same file.

```ts
imports: [
  FormsModule,
  ReactiveFormsModule,
  ... ]
```

The main application design is placed into `src/app/app.component.html`. Copy the following code into the file.

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="top-bar">
  <div class="top-bar-left">
    <button routerLink="/">{{title}}</button>
  </div>
  <div class="top-bar-right">
    <button class="button" *ngIf="!isAuthenticated" (click)="oktaAuth.loginRedirect()"> Login </button>
    <button class="button" *ngIf="isAuthenticated" (click)="oktaAuth.logout()"> Logout </button>
  </div>
</div>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```
{% endraw %}

The `<div class="top-bar">` element defines the application's toolbar at the top of the page. It contains a link to the wiki's home page and a button that lets the user log in or out. You will notice the use of the `isAuthenticated` flag and the `oktaAuth` property. These have been made available through the application component in `src/app/app.component.ts` by the Okta schematic that you applied to the client in the previous step. The `<router-outlet>` is the container in which the router will render its content.

## Implement Your Angular + Firebase Wiki

The wiki client will need to connect to the Firebase server. Google provides Node and Angular libraries to interface with the database. As usual, they can be installed with `npm`.

```bash
npm install --save @angular/fire@5.1.1 firebase@5.8.4
```

The modules have to be made available to the app. Open `src/app/app.module.ts` again and add the following imports and configuration.

```ts
import { AngularFireModule } from '@angular/fire';
import { AngularFirestoreModule } from '@angular/fire/firestore';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "<Firebase API key>",
  authDomain: "<Firebase auth domain>",
  databaseURL: "<Firebase database URL>",
  projectId: "<Firebase project ID>",
  storageBucket: "<Firebase storage bucket>",
  messagingSenderId: "<Firebase messaging sender ID>",
};
```

You can simply paste the information you obtained from the Firebase console into the configuration object. Further down in the same file, add both modules to the imports.

```ts
AngularFireModule.initializeApp(firebaseConfig),
AngularFirestoreModule,
```

You will load the page content into the home page. Open `src/app/home/home.component.ts` and replace the current content with the following content.

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { OktaAuthService } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { AngularFirestore } from '@angular/fire/firestore';
import { Subscription } from 'rxjs';
import { DocumentSnapshot } from '@firebase/firestore-types';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: './home.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./home.component.css']
})
export class HomeComponent implements OnInit {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  slug: string;
  content: string;
  created: number;
  modified: number;

  subs: Subscription;

  constructor(private oktaAuth: OktaAuthService,
              private db: AngularFirestore,
              private route: ActivatedRoute) {
  }

  async ngOnInit() {
    this.route.paramMap.subscribe(params => {
      this.loadPage(params.get('slug') || 'home');
    });

    this.isAuthenticated = await this.oktaAuth.isAuthenticated();
    this.oktaAuth.$authenticationState.subscribe(
      (isAuthenticated: boolean)  => this.isAuthenticated = isAuthenticated
    );
  }

  loadPage(slug) {
    if (this.subs) {
      this.subs.unsubscribe();
    }

    const doc = this.db.collection('pages').doc(slug).get();
    this.subs = doc.subscribe((snapshot) => {
      const page = snapshot.data();
      if (!page) {
        this.content = '### This page does not exist';
        this.slug = undefined;
      } else {
        this.slug = slug;
        this.content = page.content;
        this.created = page.created;
        this.modified = page.modified;
        console.log(page);
      }
    });
  }
}
```

The `HomeComponent` loads the page depending on the `slug` parameter that is passed in through the route. The Firestore API is available through the `AngularFirestore` injectable. Once loaded, the `content`, `slug` and timestamp properties are set from the data obtained. In the home component's template in `src/app/home/home.component.html`, then replace the content with the code below.

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="grid-container wiki">
  <div class="grid-x">
    <div class="small-12 cell">
      <div class="manage-post" *ngIf="isAuthenticated">
        <button class="button" [routerLink]="['/edit', slug]">Edit</button>
        <button class="button" routerLink="/edit">Create</button>
      </div>
      {{content}}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}

If the user is authenticated, the page also contains a bar with buttons to manage the page. These buttons link to the `edit` page which you will implement later on in this tutorial. Give this toolbar some style by editing `src/app/home/home.component.css`.

```css
.manage-post {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  background-color: #fafafa;
}
```

The router settings for the `home` route have to be modified from their default to account for the `slug` parameter. Open `src/app/app-routing.module.ts` and modify the `routes` array.

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {path: '', redirectTo: '/home/', pathMatch: 'full'},
  {
    path: 'home/:slug',
    component: HomeComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'home',
    component: HomeComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'callback',
    component: OktaCallbackComponent
  }
];
```

The application is now ready to show wiki pages from the Firebase server. In the terminal, run `ng serve`. Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`. You will see the content of the home page that you entered into the database. However, at this point, the markdown is not rendered correctly. This is quickly remedied. Open the terminal again and install the `ngx-markdown` package.

```bash
npm install --save ngx-markdown@7.1.3
```

Again, import the modules at the top of `src/app/app.module.ts`.

```ts
import { MarkdownModule } from 'ngx-markdown';
```

Then add the `MarkdownModule.forRoot()` to the `imports` array of `AppModule`. Next, make a minor change to `src/app/home/home.component.html` by changing {% raw %}`{{content}}`{% endraw %} to the following.

```html
<markdown [data]="content"></markdown>
```

Now, when you look at the wiki's home page you can see that the markdown is rendered properly.

## Edit Pages in Your Angular + Firebase App

Showing wiki pages is not enough for a wiki app. Of course, you will want to create new pages or edit existing ones. Create a new component using the command line tool in the terminal.

```bash
ng generate component edit
```

This will create a number of files in the `src/app/edit` directory. Open `src/app/edit/edit.component.ts` and replace its contents with the code below.

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute, Router } from '@angular/router';
import { AngularFirestore } from '@angular/fire/firestore';
import { FormGroup, FormBuilder, Validators } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-edit',
  templateUrl: './edit.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./edit.component.css']
})
export class EditComponent implements OnInit {
  editPageForm: FormGroup;
  newPage: boolean = true;
  pending: boolean = true;
  slug: string;

  constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder,
              private db: AngularFirestore,
              private route: ActivatedRoute,
              private router: Router) { }

  ngOnInit() {
        this.route.paramMap.subscribe(params => {
      const slug = params.get('slug');
      if (!slug) {
        this.initNewPage();
      } else {
        this.initEditPage(slug);
      }
    });
  }

  initNewPage() {
    this.newPage = true;
    this.pending = false;
    this.editPageForm = this.formBuilder.group({
      slug: ['', Validators.required],
      content: ['', Validators.required]
    });
  }

  initEditPage(slug) {
    const doc = this.db.collection('pages').doc(slug).get();
    const subs = doc.subscribe((snapshot) => {
      const page = snapshot.data();
      if (!page) {
        this.initNewPage();
      } else {
        this.editPageForm = this.formBuilder.group({
          content: [page.content, Validators.required]
        });
        this.newPage = false;
        this.pending = false;
        this.slug = slug;
      }
      subs.unsubscribe();
    });
  }

  savePage() {
    if (!this.editPageForm.valid) return;
    const now = Date.now();
    let slug, document;
    if (this.newPage) {
      slug = this.editPageForm.get('slug').value;
      document = {
        content: this.editPageForm.get('content').value,
        modified: now,
        created: now
      }
    } else {
      slug = this.slug;
      document = {
        content: this.editPageForm.get('content').value,
        modified: now
      }
    }
    this.db.collection('pages').doc(slug).set(document, {merge: true}).then(() => {
      this.router.navigate(['/home', slug]);
    });
  }
}
```

This component is used to process adding new pages and editing existing ones. Using the Firebase API both operations are performed using the `set` operation. The `{merge: true}` option tells Firebase not to delete properties of a document if they are not supplied in the update call. The template for the edit component, in `src/app/edit/edit.component.html` contains a simple form.

```html
<div class="grid-container wiki">
  <div class="grid-x">
    <div class="small-12 cell">
      <form [formGroup]="editPageForm" (ngSubmit)="savePage()" *ngIf="!pending">
        <label *ngIf="newPage">Slug
          <input type="text" placeholder="Slug" formControlName="slug">
        </label>
        <label>
          Page Content
          <textarea placeholder="Page Content" formControlName="content"></textarea>
        </label>
        <button class="button">Save</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Add a tiny bit of styling in `src/app/edit/edit.component.css`.

```css
input {
  width: 100%;
}

textarea {
  height: 80vh;
}
```

To make the edit component available through the router, open `src/app/app-routing.module.ts` and first, modify the import from `okta-angular` to include the `OktaAuthGuard`.

```ts
import { OktaCallbackComponent, OktaAuthGuard } from '@okta/okta-angular';
```

Next, add the import of the `EditComponent`.

```ts
import { EditComponent } from './edit/edit.component';
```

Then add the following entries to the `routes` array.

```ts
{
  path: 'edit/:slug',
  component: EditComponent,
  canActivate: [OktaAuthGuard]
},
{
  path: 'edit',
  component: EditComponent,
  canActivate: [OktaAuthGuard]
}
```

Note the `canActivate` property on these routes. They prevent any user that is not logged in from accessing the page editor. Now you are ready to test your wiki. Open the terminal and run start the Angular test server.

```bash
ng serve
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`. If you are not logged into your application, click on the **Login** link and proceed to enter your username and password. Once logged in, you should see the buttons to add a new page or edit the current one. The data is stored in your Firebase database. This means that you can run your app from anywhere and always access the same pages.
