If you've done any significant Node development in the past seven or eight years, you've probably used [Express](https://expressjs.com) to build a web server at some point. While you can create a server in Node without using a library, it doesn't give you a lot out of the box and can be quite cumbersome to add functionality. Express is a minimalist, "unopinionated" server library and has become the de facto standard for building web apps in Node. To understand Express, you need to understand Express Middleware.

## What is Express Middleware?
Middleware literally means anything you put in the middle of one layer of the software and another. Express middleware are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server.  Each middleware has access to the HTTP `request` and `response` for each route (or path) it's attached to. In fact, Express itself is compromised wholly of middleware functions. Additionally, middleware can either terminate the HTTP request or pass it on to another middleware function using `next` (more on that soon). This "chaining" of middleware allows you to compartmentalize your code and create reusable middleware.

In this article I'll explain what middleware is, why you would use it, how to use existing Express middleware, and how to write your own middleware for Express.

## Requirements to Write Express Middleware
There are a few things you will need installed to create, use, and test Express middleware. First, you will need Node and NPM. To ensure you have them installed, you can run:

```sh
npm -v && node -v
```

You should see the Node and NPM versions you have installed. If you get an error, you need to [install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). I'm using the latest version of both as of the time of this article, which is Node 10.9.0 and NPM 6.4.1, but all the examples should work with Node versions 8+ and NPM versions 5+.

I will also be using Express version 4.x. This is important because major changes were made from version 3.x to 4.x.

It will also be helpful to have [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) installed to test routes using any HTTP verbs other than `GET`.

## Express Middleware: The Basics
To get started, you'll use the most basic of Express' built-in middleware. This will give you the chance to see how middleware is used, and how Express middleware is structured.

Create a new project and `npm init` it...

```sh
npm init
npm install express --save
```

Create `server.js` and paste the following code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send('Welcome Home');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Run the server via `node server.js`, access `http://localhost:3000`, and you should see "Welcome Home" printed in your browser.

The `app.get()` function is [Application-level Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.application). You'll notice the parameters passed to the method are `req`, `res`, and `next`. These are the incoming request, the response being written, and a method to call to pass the call to the next middleware function once the current middleware is finished. In this case, once the response is sent, the function exits. You could also chain other middleware here by calling the `next()` method.

Let's take a look at a few more examples of the different types of middleware.

## Express Request Logging Middleware Example
In Express, you can set up middleware to be "global" middleware; meaning it will be called for every incoming request.

Change the contents of `server.js` to:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req);
  next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send('Welcome Home');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

This time, when you go to `http://localhost:3000` you should see the same thing in your browser window, but back in the console window you will see the output of the incoming request object.

The middleware logs out the request object and then calls `next()`. The next middleware in the pipeline handles the get request to the root URL and sends back the text response. Using `app.use()` means that this middleware will be called for every call to the application. 

## Restrict Express Request Content Type Example
In addition to running middleware for all calls, you could also specify to only run middleware for specific calls. 

Change the `server.js` file again to:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const requireJsonContent = () => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.headers['content-type'] !== 'application/json') {
        res.status(400).send('Server requires application/json')
    } else {
      next()
    }
  }
}

app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send('Welcome Home');
});

app.post('/', requireJsonContent(), (req, res, next) => {
  res.send('You sent JSON');
})

app.listen(3000);
```

This time, start the server by running:

```sh
node server.js
```

To test this, open up Postman and create a post request to `http://localhost:3000`. Don't set any headers and run the request. You will get back the "Server requires application/json" message.

Now go back and add the `Content-Type` header with a value of `application/json` and run the request again. You will get the "You sent JSON" message back from the server.

This `app.post()` method call adds the `requireJsonContent()` middleware function to ensure the incoming request payload has a `Content-Type` header value set to `application/json`. If it doesn't pass the check, an error response is sent. If it does, the request is then handed off to the next piece of middleware in the chain via the `next()` method.

## Third-Party Express Middleware
You've built a couple of custom middlewares to far, but there are lots of packages already built to do the things you might normally want to do. In fact, you've used the simple routing middleware library by using the `app.get()` or `app.post()` middleware functions. There are thousands of middleware libraries for doing things like parsing incoming data, routing, and authorization. 

Okta has an Express middleware for OIDC security that I'll show you to demonstrate using third-party middleware libraries.


### Why Okta for Express Applications
At Okta, our goal is to make [identity management](https://developer.okta.com/product/user-management/) a lot easier, more secure, and more scalable than what you're used to. Okta is a cloud service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or multiple applications. Our API enables you to:

- [Authenticate](https://developer.okta.com/product/authentication/) and [authorize](https://developer.okta.com/product/authorization/) your users
- Store data about your users
- Perform password-based and [social login](https://developer.okta.com/authentication-guide/social-login/)
- Secure your application with [multi-factor authentication](https://developer.okta.com/use_cases/mfa/)
- And much more! Check out our [product documentation](https://developer.okta.com/documentation/)

## Okta's OIDC Express Middleware
To install Okta's OIDC middleware for Express, run:

```sh
npm install @okta/oidc-middleware@0.1.3 --save
```

Then in the `server.js` file, you create an instance if the middleware with some configuration options so that Okta knows how to connect to your Okta application.

```js
const oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  client_id: '{yourClientId}',
  client_secret: '{yourClientSecret}',
  redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback',
  scope: 'openid profile'
});
```

You'll also need to tell Express to use the OIDC middleware router instead of the default router.

```js
app.use(oidc.router);
```

Then you use it like any other middleware:

```js
app.get('/protected', oidc.ensureAuthenticated(), (req, res) => {
  res.send('Top Secret');
});
```

The `oidc.ensureAuthenticated()` function is a middleware in the Okta library. It runs a function to see if the current user is logged in. If they are, it calls `next()` to let the `app.get()` function continue handling the request. If they aren't it will send back an `HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)` response.

## Middleware Order is Important
When a request is received by Express, each middleware that matches the request is run in the order it is initialized until there is a terminating action (like a response being sent). 

{% img blog/express-middleware-examples/middleware.png alt:"Middleware Flow" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

So if an error occurs, all middleware that is meant to handle errors will be called in order until one of them does not call the `next()` function call.

## Error Handling in Express Middleware
Express has a built-in default error handler that is inserted at the end of the middleware pipeline that handles any unhandled errors that may have occurred in the pipeline. Its signature adds an error parameter to the standard parameters of request, response, and next. The basic signature looks like this:

```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // middleware functionality here
})
```

In order to call an error-handling middleware, you simply pass the error to `next()`, like this:

```js
app.get('/my-other-thing', (req, res, next) => {
  next(new Error('I am passing you an error!'));
});

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.log(err);    
  if(!res.headersSent){
    res.status(500).send(err.message);
  }
});
```

In this case, the error handling middleware at the end of the pipeline will handle the error. You might also notice that I checked the `res.headersSent` property. This just checks to see if the response has already sent the headers to the client. If it hasn't it sends a 500 HTTP status and the error message to the client. You can also chain error-handling middleware. This is common to handle different types of errors in different ways. For instance:

```js

app.get('/nonexistant', (req, res, next) => {
  let err = new Error('I couldn\'t find it.');
  err.httpStatusCode = 404;
  next(err);
});

app.get('/problematic', (req, res, next) => {
  let err = new Error('I\'m sorry, you can\'t do that, Dave.');
  err.httpStatusCode = 304;
  next(err);
});

// handles not found errors
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  if (err.httpStatusCode === 404) {
    res.status(400).render('NotFound');
  }
  next(err);
});

// handles unauthorized errors
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  if(err.httpStatusCode === 304){
    res.status(304).render('Unauthorized');
  }
  next(err);
})

// catch all
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.log(err);
  if (!res.headersSent) {
    res.status(err.httpStatusCode || 500).render('UnknownError');
  }
});
```

In this case, the middleware checks to see if a 404 (not found) error was thrown. If so, it renders the 'NotFound' template page and then passes the error to the next item in the middleware. The next middleware checks to see if a 304 (unauthorized) error was thrown. If it was, it renders the 'Unauthorized' page, and passes the error to the next middleware in the pipeline. Finally the "catch all" error handler just logs the error and if no response has been sent, it sends the error's `httpStatusCode` (or an HTTP 500 status if none is provided) and renders the 'UnknownError' template.
