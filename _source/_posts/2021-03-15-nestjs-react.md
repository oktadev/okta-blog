NestJS is a node.js framework that boasts the ability to build efficient, reliable, and scalable applications.  A NestJS application can serve as the backend for your SPA.  

In this tutorial, you will use React, one of the most popular javascript front-end libraries available to build your SPA, and then use NestJS for your server.  To secure everything, you will level Okta's simple and powerful single sign-on provider.  

You will learn how to authenticate a user to React using Okta.  Okta will then issue a JWT to your SPA, which you can relay to the NestJS application.  NestJS is built with external libraries in mind, meaning it's straightforward to use Okta's JWT verifier to validate the JWT and ensure the user is authorized to access the resources on your server.

## Create your Okta Application

To start, you will need a forever-free Okta developer's account.  If you don't have one, you can [sign up here](https://developer.okta.com/developer/signup/).  For this tutorial, you will be creating your application using Okta's new CLI tool.  If you haven't used it before, I highly encourage you to check out [this tutorial](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/12/10/introducing-okta-cli) or check out the [official documentation](https://cli.okta.com/).

Once you are logged into the CLI, run `okta apps create` and begin the setup.  Give your application a meaningful name; I called my `nest-js`.  Next select *Single Page App*.  Change your *Redirect URI* to `http://localhost:3000/callback` and your *Post Logout Redirect URI* to `http://localhost:3000/`. The CLI will return your *Issuer* and *Client ID*.  Make note of both of these as you will need them in your applications.  

## Create your React Application

Now that you have your application set up in Okta, you can create your React application.  For this, you can use the `create-react-app` task runner. Use `npx create-react-app nestjs-frontend` to begin your application set up.  For this project, I named my react app *nestjs-frontend*, but you can name yours whatever you like.

After the task runner has scaffolded React for you it's time to install a few packages.  First, install `bootstrap` since it's a nice, easy CSS library.

```console
npm i bootstrap@4.5.3
```

Okta provides a couple of useful libraries to help facilitate securing your application.  You will want to install these next.

```console
npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@4.7.2
npm i @okta/okta-react@4.1.0
```

You'll also be using a library that allows you to use a local file to store properties that will be read as environment variables in React, called `dotenv`.

```console
npm i dotenv@8.2.0
```

The last step before coding your application is to set up your `.env` file.  Add a new file called `.env` to the root of your front-end application and add the following values to it.

```shell
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourOktaClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE={yourOktaDomain}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
PORT=3000
```

You will plug in the Okta CLI client ID you received earlier and your Okta organization URL (e.g. https://dev-123456.okta.com).

Next, add a file to your `src` folder called `AppWithRouterAccess.jsx`.  Add the following code to it.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Security, LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

import Home from './Pages/Home'

const AppWithRouterAccess = () => {
  const issuer =  process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE + '/oauth2/default'
  const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
  const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + '/callback';

  const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
    issuer: issuer,
    clientId: clientId,
    redirectUri: redirect
  });

  return (
    <Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth}>
      <Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home} />
      <Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback} />
    </Security>
  );
};
export default AppWithRouterAccess;
```

This class provides the setup for your application's authentication.  It wraps your application in a `Security` component that's initialized with your Okta settings.  That way you will have access to the `oktaAuth` object on any of the paths defined within.

Next, open your `app.js` file and replace the code with the following.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import AppWithRouterAccess from './AppWithRouterAccess';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <AppWithRouterAccess/>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Here you are using the `AppWithRouterAccess` you just created.  This is also the appropriate place to import `bootstrap` to use with your application.

Next, add a folder called `Components` and add a file called `Header.jsx`.  Add the following code to it.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

const Header = () => {
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

  if (authState.isPending) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  const button = authState.isAuthenticated ? (
    <button
      className="btn btn-secondary"
      onClick={() => {
        oktaAuth.signOut("/");
      }}
      >
      Logout
    </button>
    ) : (
    <button
      className="btn btn-secondary"
      onClick={() => {
        oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
      }}
    >
      Login
    </button>
  );

  return (
    <div className="navbar" bg="light" expand="lg">
      <div className="navbar" href="/">
        NestJS To Do List
      </div>
      <div className="navbar" aria-controls="basic-navbar-nav"></div>
      <div className="navbar" id="basic-navbar-nav">
        <div className="navbar mr-auto"></div>
        <form className="inline">{button}</form>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
export default Header;
```

This header provides a title for the website and a button for logging in or out, depending on the value of `authState.isAuthenticated`.  The button then uses the `oktaAuth` object to call `signOut` or `signInWithRedirect`, depending on which is appropriate.  The `signInWithRedirect` function will redirect the user to the Okta-hosted login page and return the authentication information to the callback you defined in `AppWithRouterAccess` before.  Once the user signs in, you will have access to the requested authentication details.

In that same folder, add a file called `ToDoList.jsx` and add the following code.

```jsx
import React from "react";

const ToDoList = ({ authState, list, onCompleteItem }) => {
  if (!authState.isAuthenticated) {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>
          Hey there, it looks like you aren't logged in yet. To log in, click here.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  } else if (!list) {
    return <div className="container">Loading....</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <table className="table table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th width="15%">Complete</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        {list.map((item, i) => {
          return (
            <tr key={i}>
              <td>{item.text}</td>
              <td>
                <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={() => onCompleteItem(item)}>
                  Complete
                </button>
              </td>
            </tr>
          );
        })}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
  );
};
export default ToDoList;
```

This component does a couple of things.  First, it checks if the user is authenticated and, if not, directs them to log in.  In practice, the user should never see this because the `Home` page you will implement shortly will prevent this.  It also checks if `list` is populated.  If not, it displays a message that your application is loading.  Finally, if the list exists then, it shows it in a simple table.  The table has a column with a button for marking the items complete.  The logic for this will also be on your `Home` page.

You will want to implement that next.  Add a folder called `Pages` and add a file to that folder called `Home.jsx`.  This is a relatively simple application, and you will only have one page.  Add the following code to that file.

{% raw %}
```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { withOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import ToDoList from "../Components/ToDoList";
import Header from "../Components/Header";

export default withOktaAuth(class Home extends Component {
  constructor(props, context) {
    super(props, context);

    this.state = {
      list: undefined,
      loadingList: false,
    };

    this.markItemAsComplete = this.markItemAsComplete.bind();
  }

  componentDidMount = () => {
    this.getCurrentItems();
  };

  componentDidUpdate = (prevProps, prevState, snapshot) => {
    this.getCurrentItems();
  };

  getCurrentItems() {
    if (
      this.props.authState.isAuthenticated &&
      !this.state.list &&
      !this.state.loadingList
    ) {
      this.setState({
        loadingList: true,
      });

      var itemsUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER_BASE_URL + "/todolist";

      fetch(itemsUrl, {

        headers: new Headers({
          Authorization: "bearer " + this.props.authState.accessToken.value,
        }),
      })
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((result) => {

        },
        (error) => {
          console.log(error);
          this.setState({ loadingList: false });
        }
      );
    }
  }

  markItemAsComplete = (item) => {
    var itemsUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_SERVER_BASE_URL + "/todolist";

    var data = {
      id: item.id
    };

    fetch(itemsUrl, {
      method: "post",
      headers: new Headers({
        Authorization: "bearer " + this.props.authState.accessToken.value,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      }),
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    })
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((result) => {
      if (result.success) {
        var list = this.state.list.filter(function (i) {
          return i.id !== item.id;
        });

        this.setState({ list: list });
      }
    },
    (error) => {
      console.log(error);
    });
  };

  render() {
    var body = this.props.authState.isAuthenticated ? (

{% endraw %}

Here you have a `getCurrentItems()` function that gets called when the component is loaded.  This uses `fetch()` to contain the server you defined in your `.env` file.  That server isn't operational yet, but that's where your NestJS application will be.  Similarly, there is a function for `markItemAsComplete()`.  This function will also call your NestJS application and request the item selected to be marked as complete; then, it will remove the item from the table.  This is injected into the `ToDoList.jsx` component from before.  Finally, if your user isn't authenticated, you will display a small welcome page for the user.  

At this point, you can now run `npm run start` and let your application load.  Your lists won't load, but you should be able to see the application.

{% img blog/nestjs-react/app-homepage.png alt:"Application Homepage" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## Create your NestJS Application

Now it's time to get the backend written for your application.  Navigate back to your root directory.  If you haven't installed the NestJS CLI yet, then now is the time.  Run `npm i -g @nestjs/cli` and wait for that to complete.  Next, run `nest new nestjs-backend` to create a new nest project next to your frontend React app.  I named mine *nestjs-backend*, but you can call yours whatever is meaningful to you. You'll be asked to choose which package manager you want to use. Choose `npm` to use all the commands that follow.

> NOTE: You may get some `WARNING` messages when running the NestJS CLI or installing dependencies. This seems to be related to npm version 7+ and doesn't seem to affect the application.

This process takes a moment, but you can begin to install your packages once it's complete.

First, as usual, install `dotenv`.

```console
npm i dotenv@8.2.0
```

Next, you will need a few packages for authenticating your user and setting up the auth modules.  To do this, you will level `passport` and Okta's jwt verifier.  You can install these now.

```console
npm i passport@0.4.1
npm i passport-http-bearer@1.0.1
npm i @nestjs/passport@7.1.5
npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@1.0.1
```

Next, add a file to the root of your backend directory called `.env` and add the following code.

```shell
OKTA_CLIENTID={yourOktaClientId}
OKTA_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuer}
OKTA_AUDIENCE=api://default
APP_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3001
```

You will plug in your client ID and issuer you received from the Okta CLI earlier.

Now, open your `src` folder.  The rest of this tutorial will take place there.

In `src` you'll see a file called `main.ts`.  Replace the code in there with the following.

```ts
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.enableCors();
  await app.listen(3001);
}
bootstrap();
console.log('app started');
```

Most of this code is boilerplate from NestJS, although you are also enabling CORS so that your React application can make requests to this server.  To avoid conflicts, you changed the port this application is running on to `3001`.  This should match what your React application is expecting to call.  

Next, open `app.service.ts` and replace the code with the following.

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getToDoList(): any[] {
    return [
      {
        id: 1,
        text: 'Clean the dishes',
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        text: 'Cook Dinner',
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        text: 'Take out the trash',
      },
      {
        id: 4,
        text: 'Legdrop off the ropes',
      },
      {
        id: 5,
        text: 'Brush your teeth',
      },
    ];
  }

  markAsComplete(id: any): any {
    console.log(id);

    return {
      success: true,
      error: '',
    };
  }
}
```

The service component here defines the logic for the `markAsComplete()` and `getToDoList()` methods.  These are stubbed out, but you can connect them to a persistent storage if you want.

Next, replace the code in `app.module.ts` with the following.

```ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { AuthModule } from './auth/auth.module';

@Module({
  imports: [AuthModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The change here from the stock code is that you are now listing `AuthModule` as an import.  This should throw an error at this point since you haven't created the auth module yet.

Finally, edit your `app.controller.ts` to the code below.

```ts
import { Controller, Get, Post, UseGuards, Body } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get('/todolist')
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('bearer'))
  getToDoList(): any[] {
    return this.appService.getToDoList();
  }

  @Post('/todolist')
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('bearer'))
  markAsComplete(@Body() id: any): any {
    return this.appService.markAsComplete(id);
  }
}
```

Here you are defining your routes and the logic within them.  The syntax here is pretty self-explanatory.  You can decorate methods with `@Get` or `@Post` (or, of course, any HTTP Method) and provide a route in the argument.  Next, you are using the `AuthGuard()` guard.  You have injected the `app.service.ts` class with the `app.module.ts` and, in the constructor of this controller, you've accepted that argument.  Now you can call the `getToDoList()` or `markAsComplete()` methods in the service.  

Now, you will need to set up your auth module. First, you need to access the config variables found in `.env`.  NestJS prefers you inject the configuration rather than accessing with `process.env`, so start by creating a folder under `src` called `config`.  

Add a file for `config.module.ts` and add the following code.

```ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';

import { ConfigService } from './config.service';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: ConfigService,
      useValue: new ConfigService(`${process.env.NODE_ENV || ''}.env`),
    },
  ],
  exports: [ConfigService],
})
export class ConfigModule {}
```

This class allows you to inject the `ConfigService` into other classes that need access to it.  Create the `config.service.ts` file in the same directory and add the `ConfigService` code found below.

```ts
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import * as fs from 'fs';

export class ConfigService {
  private readonly envConfig: { [key: string]: string };

  constructor(filePath: string) {
    this.envConfig = dotenv.parse(fs.readFileSync(filePath));
  }

  get(key: string): string {
    return this.envConfig[key];
  }
}
```

This class provides the logic for getting the values from the `.env` file by parsing the file and returning the value based on the key.  

You are all set up now to complete the authentication portion of your application.  Under your `src` folder, add a folder called `auth` and add a file for `auth.module.ts` with the following code.

```ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';

import { ConfigModule } from '../config/config.module';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { HttpStrategy } from './http.strategy';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  providers: [HttpStrategy, AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

This should start becoming a pattern for you.  The module defines the imports and providers for the class.  Next, add the `auth.service.ts` file to the same folder and add the following code.

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as OktaJwtVerifier from '@okta/jwt-verifier';

import { ConfigService } from '../config/config.service';

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  private oktaVerifier: any;
  private audience: string;

  constructor(private readonly config: ConfigService) {
    this.oktaVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
      issuer: config.get('OKTA_ISSUER'),
      clientId: config.get('OKTA_CLIENTID'),
    });

    this.audience = config.get('OKTA_AUDIENCE');
  }

  async validateToken(token: string): Promise<any> {
    const jwt = await this.oktaVerifier.verifyAccessToken(token, this.audience);
    return jwt;
  }
}
```

Once again, the service will contain the actual logic for your module.  Here you are using Okta's JWT verifier to verify the token.  You don't even need to parse any information from the token.  If the token is invalid, then `oktaVerifier` will throw an exception that you can catch later on.  This piece simply takes your issuer, clientId, audience and validates your token against it.

Finally, add `http.strategy.ts` to the same folder.  The code for this is below.

```ts
import { HttpException, Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { Strategy } from 'passport-http-bearer';

import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable()
export class HttpStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor(private readonly authService: AuthService) {
    super();
  }

  async validate(
    token: string,
    done: (error: HttpException, value: boolean | string) => any,
  ) {
    try {
      return await this.authService.validateToken(token);
    } catch (error) {
      done(error, 'The token is not valid');
    }
  }
}
```

This class ties everything together.  It is registered as a provider for the auth module, which is injected into the app controller, which uses the `AuthGuard` that looks for a passport strategy to tell it how to authenticate the user.  In this case, using your auth service class that knows how to use the Okta JWT Verifier.  

Now you can run `nest start,` and this application should be ready to start.

## Test and Run
