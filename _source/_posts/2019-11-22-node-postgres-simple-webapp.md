Node.js boasts high performance and scalability for web, mobile, or desktop applications. It is one of the fastest-growing and best-supported javascript frameworks available today, and its microservice patterns has made it a hit for modern enterprise applications. PostgreSQL has also risen in popularity, to compete with MySql. The two technologies partner well as a foundation for modern, microservices-based applications.

In this post, we will build a small application that keeps track of a To-Do List and the status of tasks, all built on Node and Postgres.

To connect the two you will use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) called Sequelize, available via the Node Package Manager, npmjs. Sequelize fits beautifully over Postgres, MSSql, MySql, and MariaDB with no need to rewrite code. This tutorial will also use Express.js, because it makes working with Node so simple. You'll need a proper IDE for Node development, and we use Visual Studio Code in this example, because it's free, lightweight, and extensible.

Finally, to power authentication, you will use [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) , and its Okta OIDC Middleware and the Node.js SDK.

## Set Up PostgreSQL

Postgres is incredibly simple to set up. First, you will need to [download the distribution](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) that matches your server's operating system. I installed [version 12 on Windows 10 - 64bit](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). Follow the instructions in the installer, and you're just about ready to go.

Next, you will need to set up a Postgres database. To do so, you will use the SQL Shell that comes with Postgres. You can review the [full documentation here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/tutorial-accessdb.html), but, I will just show you how to create a new database.

As part of your installation, Postgres will install SQL Shell your workstation. Open SQL Shell and it will prompt you for the server, database, username, and password. Hopefully, you remember these from when you installed the database.

{% img blog/node-postgres-simple-webapp/sql-shell.jpg alt:"SQL Shell" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Log in and create your first database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE TODOLIST;
```

> **Note:** In Postgres syntax, the semicolon is a must. If you do not put a semicolon in Sql Shell, it will wait until it sees one to complete the command. Typically, your next command will return a syntax error when you do add the semicolon.

You can verify that your database was created by using the `\list` command. Switch to your new `TODOLIST` database using `\TODOLIST`.

From here, you will create a table named `Item` that holds most of your application data:.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Item ( id serial primary key, title varchar(100), description text, isComplete boolean);
```

If you have any experience with SQL, this syntax should look very familiar. It starts by calling the `Create Table` function and naming your table `Item`, followed by the table's structure in parenthesis. By convention, you will name the first column `id` to provide a `primary key` for the table. In Postgres, the `serial` type is used to denote an auto incrementing integer that is not null. `Title` is a varchar, or a string, with a maximum limit of 100 characters. `Description` is marked as a text field and therefore has no limit on the number of characters used, but is more difficult to search. `IsComplete` is a boolean value that indicates if the `Item` is completed by the user.

Now you have a database set up and ready to accept your items from your web server.

## Create Your Node Application

Now, create a directory for your node application. You can do that with the following commands:

```sh
mkdir todolist
cd todolist
```

Use `npm init` to go through a wizard that will prompt up for various configuration details, including the entry point, author, name, and test scripts. Skip these questions and use the default fields by using `npm init -y`.

Now that Node has been initialized on your directory you can start framing out your project structure.

First, create folders for `config`, `repository`, `routes`, `server`, and `views`.

In the `config` folder, you will create a general configuration file named `config.js` and a specific one for `index.js` that will serve as your entry point.

In the `repository` folder, create a file named `todoitems_repository.js`. This will serve as the access layer to your Postgres database.

For `routes` you will have two routes; `items.js` and `users.js`. `items.js` will contain the routing logic for your list and creation of new items. `users.js` will contain the routes you need to present the user with a login page. Note, you won't need login functionality, as that will be handled by the Okta middleware.

In the Server folder, create a `server.js` file to contain your server logic that register middleware, instantiate your routes, and handle any unhandled errors for your server.

Finally, add 5 views: `create.pug`, `error.pug`, `home.pug`, `layout.pug`, and `login.pug`. The `layout.pug` file provides a template for each page and provides common page functionalities like headers and footers. The `home.pug` file will be your dashboard page that displays the list of incomplete `items` to the user. The file `create.pug` provides your user a place to create a new `item`. The `login.pug` file gives unauthenticated users a landing page and provides a link to your Okta login page, and the `error.pug` file displays a generic error page if your server encountered an unexpected hiccup.

{% img blog/node-postgres-simple-webapp/todo-file-structure.jpg alt:"ToDo App File Structure" width:"450" %}{: .center-image }

## Register Your Node Dependencies

For this project, you'll use a handful of dependencies from the Node Package Manager via the following terminal commands.

First, you need to add express.js and to help handle session parameters, you will also want to get Express Session:

```sh
npm install express@4.14.0
npm install express-session@1.17.0
```

For your ORM, Sequelize is one of the easiest and most powerful options available on Node. In addition to Sequelize, you will also need the `pg` package, which handles Postgres:

```sh
npm install sequelize@5.19.3
npm install pg@7.12.1
```

Of course, to make it even easier to interface with Okta, add our OIDC middleware, as well as the Okta Node SDK:

```sh
npm install @okta/oidc-middleware@2.0.0
npm install @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs@2.0.1
```

To render your views, add the [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) view engine:

```sh
npm install pug@2.0.4
```

Finally, two utility packages, http-status and body-parser provide properties for HTTP Status Codes and convert the form data or JSON to javascript objects.

```sh
npm install body-parser@1.19.0
npm install http-status@0.2.5
```

## Connect the Node Application to the Postgres Database

Let's now connect your application to your database. In `todoitems_repository.js`, start a new instance of Sequelize. First, create a function called `initSequelize` and add your initialization logic there:

```javascript
var sequelize = new Sequelize(config.database, config.user, config.password, {
  host: config.server,
  dialect: 'postgres',
  define: {
    freezeTableName: true,
    timestamps: false
  }
});
```

You'll notice you set `freezeTableName` to true. This offers greater control over how Sequelize names the models in your code. The `dialect` property tells Sequelize that it is using Postgres.

Next, define your `Item` model from the database in your Node application. At the top of your `todoitems_repository.js` file, under the sequelize declaration, create a `ToDoItem` class that extends a `Sequelize.Model`:

```javascript
class ToDoItem extends Sequelize.Model {}
```

Back in your `initSequelize` function, add the full model definition for `ToDoItem`:

```javascript
ToDoItem.init(
  {
    id: {
      type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
      allowNull: false,
      primaryKey: true,
      autoIncrement: true
    },
    title: {
      type: Sequelize.STRING,
      allowNull: false
    },
    description: {
      type: Sequelize.STRING,
      allowNull: false
    },
    iscomplete: {
      type: Sequelize.BOOLEAN,
      allowNull: false
    }
  },
  {
    sequelize,
    tableName: 'Item'
  }
);
```

Once you have Sequelize set up, you can implement a repository function to utilize Sequelize to perform database operations. he javascript `Object.create` method will declare the exposed functions:

```javascript
const repository = function(config) {
  var sequelize = initSequelize(config);
  Object.create({
    disconnect,
    createToDoItem,
    getAllIncompleteToDoItems,
    markAsComplete
  });
};
```

Of course, you can't use these functions unless they are defined, so let's modify the repository function to implement these methods using Sequelize. It should look like this:

```javascript
const repository = function(config) {
  var sequelize = initSequelize(config);

  const disconnect = function() {
    sequelize.close();
  };

  const createToDoItem = function(title, description) {
    return ToDoItem.create({
      title: title,
      description: description,
      iscomplete: false
    });
  };

  const markAsComplete = function(id) {
    return ToDoItem.update(
      {
        iscomplete: true
      },
      {
        where: {
          id: id
        }
      }
    );
  };

  const getAllIncompleteToDoItems = function() {
    return ToDoItem.findAll({
      where: {
        iscomplete: false
      }
    });
  };

  return Object.create({
    disconnect,
    createToDoItem,
    getAllIncompleteToDoItems,
    markAsComplete
  });
};
```

The function above provides you with common methods that modify your ToDoItems, such as `update`, `create`, `delete`, and `findAll`. Sequelize functions take objects that can carry information for your `where` select options, your `update` options, and your `where` clauses.

Importantly, this function will not return a list of `ToDoItems`, as it might appear. Sequelize is promise-based, and therefore this function will return a promise. IYou will need to allow the promise to resolve in your service layer to retrieve your true list of `ToDoItems`.

## Set up Routes

In your two routes files (`users.js`, `items.js`) you will set up the actions the client can take against the server.

You start with the simpler `users` route and set up two separate actions, one for logging out and one for serving your `login` page to an unauthenticated user. Because Okta handles the login process for us, you don't need to worry about that part.

```javascript
app.get(basepath + '/logout', (request, response, next) => {
  request.logout();
  response.redirect('/');
});

app.get(basepath + '/index', (request, response, next) => {
  if (!request.userContext) {
    return response.render('login');
  } else {
    return response.redirect('/');
  }
});
```

This simply checks if the user is already logged in. If they are not, it shows the user the login page. Otherwise, it allows the user to move on to the home page.

The home page and server calls to manage your items will be controlled by the items routes. Below you can see the routes set up for the calls you will need.

```javascript
app.get(basepath, ensureAuthenticated, function(request, response) {
  repo
    .getAllIncompleteToDoItems()
    .then(items => {
      response.render('home', {
        user: request.userContext.userinfo,
        items: items
      });
    })
    .catch(err => {
      response.render('error');
    });
});

app.get(basepath + '/create', ensureAuthenticated, function(request, response) {
  response.render('create');
});

app.post(basepath + '/items/create', ensureAuthenticated, function(
  request,
  response
) {
  repo
    .createToDoItem(request.body.title, request.body.description)
    .then(data => {
      response.redirect('/');
    })
    .catch(err => {
      response.render('error');
    });
});

app.post(basepath + '/items/complete', ensureAuthenticated, function(
  request,
  response
) {
  repo
    .markAsComplete(request.body.id)
    .then(data => {
      response.redirect('/');
    })
    .catch(err => {
      response.render('error');
    });
});

function ensureAuthenticated(request, response, next) {
  if (!request.userContext) {
    return response.status(401).redirect('../users/index');
  }

  next();
}
```

This registers two routes for the two pages that `items` will serve; create and home, and set up two post methods. One creates any new items a user inputs, while the other lets the user mark an item as complete.

As I mentioned before, Sequelize is promise-based. When you call `getAllIncompleteItems`, it returns a promise. By calling `then` on the promise, it is allowed to resolve and hook into the result (a list of `items`) in the callback function. In this case, part of the model that `home.pug` uses to render the content supplies the items.

Also,the `ensureAuthenticated()` function is passed in as a route handler and evaluated before the request is handled. `ensureAuthenticated()` asks if the user is authenticated, like your login page (but backward). If they are not, it redirect them back to the login page from your `users` route with a standard 401 status.

## Build the Node Server

Next, register your middleware and take care of any error handling in a `server.js` file away from your entry point.

Register Pug as your view engine and set up `body-parser` to look for form data coming from the client:

```javascript
app.set('view engine', 'pug');
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```

`body-parser` also has built-in functionality for JSON if you want to post from javascript on the client, but it's not necessary for this simple project.

Next, register routes in the application. To do this, inject the application into the route managers and any objects you need. For example, the `items` route will need access to your repository, while the `users` routes do not.

```javascript
items(app, options);
users(app, null);
```

Finally, you can start your server:

```javascript
const server = app.listen(options.port, function() {
  resolve(server);
});
```

Notice you injected the options from your entry point, which you will see shortly.

Your `start` function in the `server.js` file should look like below:

```javascript
const start = function(options) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, p) => {
      console.log('Unhandled Rejection at: Promise', p, 'reason:', reason);
    });

    if (!options.port) {
      reject(new Error('no port specified'));
    }

    if (!options.repo) {
      reject(new Error('no repo'));
    }

    const app = express();

    app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, '../views'));
    app.set('view engine', 'pug');

    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

    app.use(function(error, request, response, next) {
      reject(new Error('something went wrong' + error));
      response.status(500).send('something went wrong');
    });

    const oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
      issuer: options.okta.url + '/oauth2/default',
      client_id: options.okta.clientId,
      client_secret: options.okta.clientSecret,
      appBaseUrl: options.okta.appBaseUrl,
      scope: 'openid profile',
      routes: {
        login: {
          path: '/users/login'
        },
        callback: {
          path: '/authorization-code/callback',
          defaultRedirect: '/'
        }
      }
    });

    app.use(
      session({
        secret: '{some really long random string}',
        resave: true,
        saveUninitialized: false
      })
    );

    app.use(oidc.router);

    items(app, options);
    users(app, null);

    const server = app.listen(options.port, function() {
      resolve(server);
    });
  });
};
```

## Set Up Okta for Single Sign On Management

If you don't have an Okta account, [sign up for a free-forever developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

Log into your account and head to the **Applications** area of the site. Click on **Add Application** and follow the wizard. Select **Web** for the application type. Make sure to reconcile the base domain that Okta and your Node application use. Okta defaults to `localhost:8080`, while your Node app listens to port 3000 (more on this later). In your Okta Application, change the login redirect to `localhost:3000`. Then click **Done**.

{% img blog/node-postgres-simple-webapp/okta-app-settings.png alt:"Okta App Settings" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

One you're set up, Okta will provide you with a few key pieces of information to properly interface with the platform; client ID and client secret will be at the bottom of the application's **General** tab. The URL base that will power your login screen will be located at the top of your Okta dashboard. Make sure to copy these down!

Next, in the Okta menu, use the **API** menu item at the top of the page and choose **Tokens** and create a new token.

Now, include client ID, client secret, the URL base and your API token in your `config.js` file.

```javascript
const oktaSettings = {
  clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENTID || { yourClientId },
  clientSecret: process.env.OKTA_CLIENTSECRET || { yourClientSecret },
  url: process.env.OKTA_URL_BASE || https://{ yourOktaDomain },
  apiToken: process.env.OKTA_API_TOKEN || { yourApiToken },
  appBaseUrl: process.env.OKTA_APP_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'
};
```

Export these to `index.js` and inject them into your `server.js` file for use when registering the OIDC middleware:

```javascript
const oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
  issuer: options.okta.url + "/oauth2/default",
  client_id: options.okta.clientId,
  client_secret: options.okta.clientSecret,
  appBaseUrl: options.okta.appBaseUrl,
  scope: 'openid profile',
  routes: {
    login: {
      path: "/users/login"
    },
    callback: {
      path: "/authorization-code/callback",
      defaultRedirect: "/"
    }
  }
});

app.use(session({
  secret: { some very long, random string },
  resave: true,
  saveUninitialized: false
}));
```

By registering the OIDC, you also tell Okta to that `/users/login` is your login page. Note, the callback needs to be the same as the one set up in your application in the Okta Admin Site.

You will use `openid` and `profile` for the scope in this example. `openid` provides the bare authentication details while the profile provides user information. You can read more about [scopes in Okta's documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#scopes).

## Configuration Recap

At this point, review your configuration settings and ensure you are ready to set up your entry point. To start, you want to set up your `index.js` in the `config` folder.

```javascript
const { dbSettings, serverSettings, oktaSettings } = require('./config');

module.exports = Object.assign(
  {},
  { dbSettings, serverSettings, oktaSettings }
);
```

The file is fairly simple; it just imports configuration settings from the generic config file. `config/index.js` serves to provide configuration for `index.js`. In larger applications, many separate configurations for different components can easily repackaged here for the consumer.

In your application, all the configurations are stored in one file, `config/config.js`:

```javascript
const serverSettings = {
  port: process.env.PORT || 3000
};

const dbSettings = {
  database: process.env.DB || 'todolist',
  user: process.env.DB_USER || 'postgres',
  password: process.env.DB_PASS || 'your password',
  server: process.env.DB_SERVER || 'localhost'
};

const oktaSettings = {
  clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENTID || 'yourClientId',
  clientSecret: process.env.OKTA_CLIENTSECRET || 'yourClientSecret',
  url: process.env.OKTA_URL_BASE || 'yourOktaDomain',
  apiToken: process.env.OKTA_API_TOKEN || 'yourApiToken',
  appBaseUrl: process.env.OKTA_APP_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'
};

module.exports = Object.assign(
  {},
  { dbSettings, serverSettings, oktaSettings }
);
```

To make it easier to find and access your settings in `index.js`, your configuration settings are organized into logical objects: the Okta settings have their own object, as do the database and server settings. The database settings should match the values you input when setting up Postgres. The Okta settings will come from your Okta account. Notice the environment variables: when you deploy your application, you will be given the opportunity to set these (you can also do so in Visual Studio). However, if those variables aren't set, your application will use the default values given.

## Set Up the Node Application's Entry Point

Node looks for an entry point in your application to start up. In this case, it's the `index.js` file. Here is where your server will start and inject any necessary configurations. At its heart, it is a very simple operation:

```javascript
repository.connect(dbConfig)
  .then(repo => {
    console.log('Repository Connected. Starting Server');
    rep = repo;

    return server.start({
      port: config.serverSettings.port,
      repo: repo,
      okta: config.oktaSettings
    })
  })
  .then(app => {
    console.log(`Server Started Successfully, running on port:${config.serverSettings.port}.`);
    app.on('close', function () {
      rep.disconnect();
    })
  })
})
```

All this does is connect your repository, and if that is successful, starts the server, registers your routes and middleware and listens on the selected port for incoming requests.

Starting the server, creates the opportunity to pass arguments for injection. This server passes the repo you just connected to and settings from the configuration file,including the correct port and your Okta settings.

An event called `boot.ready` connects to the repository and informs your application it is ready to start. To make this possible, wrap your connect function in an event handled for `boot.ready` using Node's `EventEmitter` class. At the end of your `index.js` file, add the `boot.ready` event that kicks off the whole process. `boot.error` handles errors, prevents the server from starting and logs the error.

```javascript
mediator.on('boot.ready', function(dbConfig) {
  let rep;

  repository
    .connect(dbConfig)
    .then(repo => {
      console.log('Repository Connected.  Starting Server');
      rep = repo;

      return server.start({
        port: config.serverSettings.port,
        repo: repo,
        okta: config.oktaSettings
      });
    })
    .then(app => {
      console.log(
        `Server Started Successfully, running on port: ${config.serverSettings.port}.`
      );
      app.on('close', function() {
        rep.disconnect();
      });
    });
});

mediator.on('db.error', function(error) {
  console.log(error);
});

mediator.emit('boot.ready', config.dbSettings);
```

## Create the Node Application Views

The [Pug view Engine](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) creates your application's views, and pages are built with bootstrap, because its nice and simple and easy for a developer to understand. Pug creates a layout page that can be extended by your children pages. For your layout page, the real challenge is ensuring that the user sees the correct display depending on if they are logged in or not.

```pug
div.d-flex.flex-column.flex-md-row.align-items-center.p-3.px-md-4.mb-3.bg-white.border-bottom.box-shadow
  h5.my-0.mr-md-auto To Do List
  nav.my-2.my-md-0.mr-md-3
  if user == undefined
    a.p-2.text-dark(href="/users/login") Log In
  else
    a.p-2.text-dark(href="/") Item List
    a.p-2.text-dark(href="/create") Create Item
    a.p-2.text-dark(href="/users/logout") Logout
.container
  block content

```

This will require your model to pass a user. If that user is null, the application will treat the user as unauthenticated and present him or her with a login option. Otherwise, it presents the user with the links for creating an item.

The `block content` keyword provides a space to render content, and comes from your child pages, as you can see on your home page:To embed a child page in `layout.pug`, in `home.pug`, create another `block content` heading that will be represented as a content block in `layout.pug`.

```pug
extends layout

block variables
- var title = 'To Do List - Home'

block content
h2.text-center #{title}

table.table.table-striped
  thead.thead-light
    tr
      th Title
      th Description
      th Is Complete
  tbody
    each item, i in items
      tr
      td #{item.title}
      td #{item.description}
      td
        form(action="items/complete", method="post")
          input(type="hidden", name="id", value=item.id)
          button.btn.btn-secondary(onClick='this.submit') Mark As Complete

```

The standard `h2` tag gives the page a title, and a new `table` displays the items. Find the `items` part of your model in the pug file use and the `each` command to create a new `tr` row and any cells necessary for the user. There is a title, description, and `form` that posts back to the `items/complete` route you registered earlier. `Items/complete` will set the `isComplete` boolean on the item to `true` and remove it from this view.

The view that creates an item uses the same layout. The `create.pug` view needs only a couple text boxes, one for `description` and one for `title`, as well as a way to actually post the data back to the server.

```pug
extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Create To Do Item'

block content
  div.card
    h5.card-header Create To Do Item
    div.card-body
      form(action="items/create", method="post")
        div.form-group
          label(for="Title") Title
          input#title.form-control(type="text", name="title")
        div.form-group
          label(for="description") Description
          textarea#description.form-control(name="description", cols="30", rows="10")
        div.form-group

If your user isn't logged in, however, they shouldn't be able to see these two pages. In your routes, the `ensureAuthenticated()` middleware displays `login.pug` page to unauthenticated users. Now your application must provide a way for the user to login.

```pug
extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Login'

block content

  p Hey there, in order to access this page, please 
    a(href="/users/login") Login here.

```

You defined `/users/login` as the login page to be managed by Okta when you created the application in the Okta dashboardClicking the link directs users to the login page provided by Okta, which handles all the authentication Of course, you could have just as easily written `ensureAuthenticated()` to reroute to `users/login` but working with pug is fun.

Finally, errors happen. Even the best developers and servers see occasional errors, and you want to make sure your user sees an appropriate error page, not one provided by the browser or a data dump of the stack.

Your application uses a very simple error page.

```pug
extends layout

block variables
  - var title = 'Oops that is an error'

block content
  p.warning We hit a little snag.  Sorry
```

The error page just informs the user that an error has occurred and they shouldn't necessarily panic. However, you may want to create multiple error pages for errors of different types, or display an error code and an email for support if you wish.

You can navigate back to your home page and see the fruits of your labor. The to-do list now correctly calls the server and requests the full list of to-do items. Of course, the server doesn't have any yet, so click **New Item** and add a thing to do. Then click on the checkbox to see your new item marked as complete. You can verify this by checking the database directly via SQL shell.
