GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides a clear description of the data and allows clients to specify what data they need, Benefits of using GraphQL include: reduced overhead,improved performance, and reduced risk of  potential errors as the API evolves. If the API enhances its functionality, existing clients won't be affected unless they want to opt in to the new features.

Clients can also obtain many resources with a single request. Typical REST APIs require the client to query multiple resources as more details are required. If, for example, a user needed information about a book, the client would reach out to a `book` endpoint. If the client then required more information about the author of that book, he/she would need to query the `author` endpoint. With GraphQL, this can be summarized in one request to the GraphQL server.  

Express is one of the most popular Node.js frameworks today. Clean and simple, it offers high performance and rapid development. In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement a GraphQL API into your Express server. You will use the npm packages provided by the GraphQL to create a new endpoint where queries can be sent. Then you will implement those queries in your Express server and return the requested data.

You will also need to ensure that your API is protected by proper authentication. For this task, you will use Okta's easy and secure Single Sign-on provider to create an authorization server. This server will supply the client with a JWT that can be validated by the Express server to ensure the user has permission to access the API. To validate the token, you will use Okta's `jwt-verifier`. This library from Okta makes authenticating the requests to your GraphQL server quick and painless.

## Set up Your Okta Authentication Server

The first thing you need to do is sign up for an [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) if you don't already have one. After you've completed the sign up, you will need to login and click on **Applications**. Click **Add Application** and select **Service Machine-To-Machine** and then **Next**. Give your application a meaningful name(I called mine GraphQL), and click **Done**. On the next page, note your *Client ID* and *Client secret* as you will need these in your application.

{% img blog/graphql-node-api/okta-app-settings.png alt:"Okta App Settings" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, click on **API** in the header and click on **Authorization Servers**. Okta will add an authorization for you named *default*. This is the one you will be using for this tutorial. Click on **Default** and then select **Scopes**. Click on **Add Scope** and name it *api*.  You can use *api* for the display name as well and give it a meaningful description.  For now you don't need to check the *User Consent*, *Default Scope*, or *Metadata Publish* options.  Click **Create** to finalize the scope.  Click on the **Settings** tab and note your *Issuer* URL. You will need this in your application as well.  

## Create your Web Application

Next, open your favorite IDE and create a new folder with the command `mkdir`. Open this folder and run the command `npm init -y`.  

### Install Your Dependencies  

Now you can begin installing your dependencies.  

First, install Express. This is the backbone of your application.  

```console
npm i express@4.17.1
```

Next, you will want to install the packages that will help support your GraphQL infrastructure. You must get both the  core GraphQL package and the Express-Graphql adapter.

```console
npm i graphql@15.3.0
npm i express-graphql@0.11.0
```

Next, install Okta's JWT-verifier, which will do the heavy lifting validating the JWTs coming from the client.

```console
npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@1.0.0
```

Finally, you will want to install dotenv to have a place to store your secure variables.

```console
npm i dotenv@8.2.0
```

### Build Your Node.js and GraphQL Web Application

First, add a file called `.env` to the root of your project. Add the following code to it.

```JSON
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientID}
OKTA_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuer}
OKTA_AUDIENCE='api://default'
APP_BASE_PORT=3000
```

Here you are using the client Id and the issuer that you obtained from your authorization server. You are also specifying which port the application will run on.  

Add a file to your root called `jwtVerifier.js`. This file will act as a wrapper around the Okta JWT verifier library. Add the following code to it:

```javascript
const OktaJwtVerifier = require('@okta/jwt-verifier')

const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
    issuer: process.env.OKTA_ISSUER,
    clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID
})

module.exports = async (request, response, next) => {

    const { authorization } = request.headers;

    if (!authorization) {
        return response.status(401).send();
    }

    const [authType, token] = authorization.trim().split(' ');

    try {
        const { claims } = await oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(token, process.env.OKTA_AUDIENCE)

        if (!claims) {
            return response.status(401).send();
        }
        if (!claims.scp.includes('api')) {
            return response.status(401).send();
        }

        return next();
    }
    catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return response.status(401).send();
    }    
}
```

The Okta JWT Verifier will produce an exception when the token is invalid, so you will need to catch the error and handle it in a way that is appropriate for your application. You also want to check to ensure the authorization header is present on the request and that a token has been issued. Finally, you want to ensure the claim contains a scope for `api` that you added earlier in your authorization server.

Next, add a file called `server.js`. This file will be the meat of your application. Add the following code to it:

```javascript
'use strict';

const express = require('express');

const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');
const { buildSchema } = require('graphql')

const jwtVerifier = require('./jwtVerifier')

const start = function (options) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        process.on("unhandledRejection", (reason, p) => {
            console.log("Unhandled Rejection at: Promise", p, "reason:", reason);
        });

        if (!options.port) {
            reject(new Error("no port specificed"));
        }

        const app = express();

        app.use(function (error, request, response, next) {
            console.log(error);
            reject(new Error("something went wrong" + error));
            response.status(500).send("something went wrong");
        });

        const schema = buildSchema(`

                            type Employee {
                                id: Int
                                first_name: String
                                last_name: String
                                email: String
                                gender: String
                                ip_address: String
                            }
                            
                            type Employees {
                                employees: [Employee]
                            }          

                            type Query {
                                employees: Employees,
                                employee(id: Int!): Employee
                            }
                    `);

        const root = {
            employees: () => {
                return data;
            },
            employee: (i) => {
                return data.employees.filter((r) => r.id == i.id)[0]
            }
        };

        app.use("/graphQl", ensureAuthenticated, graphqlHTTP({
            schema: schema,
            rootValue: root,
            graphiql: true,
        }));

        const server = app.listen(options.port, function () {
            resolve(server);
        });
    });
};

function ensureAuthenticated (request, response, next) {
    return jwtVerifier(request, response, next);
}

const data = {
    "employees": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "first_name": "Jeanette",
            "last_name": "Penddreth",
            "email": "jpenddreth0@census.gov",
            "gender": "Female",
            "ip_address": "26.58.193.2"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "first_name": "Giavani",
            "last_name": "Frediani",
            "email": "gfrediani1@senate.gov",
            "gender": "Male",
            "ip_address": "229.179.4.212"
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "first_name": "Noell",
            "last_name": "Bea",
            "email": "nbea2@imageshack.us",
            "gender": "Female",
            "ip_address": "180.66.162.255"
        },
        {
            "id": 4,
            "first_name": "Willard",
            "last_name": "Valek",
            "email": "wvalek3@vk.com",
            "gender": "Male",
            "ip_address": "67.76.188.26"
        }
    ]
}

module.exports = Object.assign({}, { start });
```

This file kicks off your Express server with the `start` function. To use GraphQL you must bring in the GraphQL module and tell your application to use it. You can specify whatever endpoint you like. Here you have set it to `/GraphQL`. At the bottom of the file is some sample data. The trick now is to connect the sample data to your `GraphQL` endpoint.

You do this by building a schema. The schema has definitions for your objects and object types. Here you have an `Employees` class, which is an array of `Employee` objects. `Employee` itself has several primitive fields attached to it. You also must define your query. Here is where you tell the client what functions are available to it via the server. In this case, you have an `employees` function that will return the full list of employees and an `employee` function that will return one employee based on a required `id` parameter. In the `root` object, you define handlers for these functions. For `employees`, you are just returning the sample data provided. For `employee`, you must collect the parameters and find the employee's data based on the id property of the query.  

You are also using the `ensureAuthenticated` middleware in the `GraphQL` endpoint. This will call your `jwtVerifier` and check the token presented in the `Authorization` header. Clients that don't provide a valid JWT will be rejected with a `401` (unauthorized) HTTP code.  

Lastly, you need to provide an entry point for your application. Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code to it:

```javascript
'use strict'

require('dotenv').config();

const server = require('./server')

const port = process.env.APP_BASE_PORT;

server.start({
    port: port
}).then(app => {
    console.log('Application is now running on port ' + port);
})
```

This file does two notable things. First, it calls dotenv's `config()` function. Per the documentation, this should be placed as early in the application as possible. Second, it kicks off the server using the server file you just created.

## Test Your GraphQL API

You can now start your application using `node index.js` from the console. To test this, I like to use [Advanced Rest Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US), but [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is another popular option. 

First, ensure your authorization is working correctly.  Create a new POST request targeting the `GraphQL` endpoint.  Set your `Content-Type` to `application/graphql`.  Add the following code to your body:

```json
{
    employees
    {
        employees
        {
            id,
            first_name
        }
    }
}
```

 Submit the request, and you should receive a `401` back from the server.

To resolve this, you first need to query your authorization server from Okta that you created at the beginning of this tutorial. Set up a new `POST` request to `{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token`. You will need to add a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You will also need to pass the following parameters in the body: `grant_type` should be set to `client_credentials`; `scope` will be set to `api` and `client_id` should be set to `{yourClientId}` and `client_secret` to `{yourClientSecret}`. Once you have these fields complete, you can make a request to the Okta authorization server, which should return a valid JWT to you.

{% img blog/graphql-node-api/api-call-get-token.png alt:"API Call Get Token" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

With your JWT, head back to your request for the  `GraphQL` endpoint and add an authorization header. The value should be `Bearer {yourJWTToken}`. Post your request again, and you should have the results passed back to you.

## Learn More About GraphQL and Node.js

You have successfully built your GraphQL API and integrated it into Express on your Node.JS server. You can enhance your API without impacting users already using this version on your GraphQL API by simply adding new fields or functionality to your schema. You have also learned how to secure the API using Okta's JWT Verification and authorization server.
