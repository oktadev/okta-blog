Quarkus is a container-first Kubernetes Java framework designed to have a super-fast start-up time and low memory usage. The container-first strategy emphasizes packaging the runtime environment along with the application code, allowing both to be tightly optimized and avoiding the endless updates and configuration problems that can come along with monolithic server systems. Quarkus was built from the beginning to support compilation to native code for use with Graal/SubstrateVM but also supports the good old JVM with OpenJDK HotSpot. 

Quarkus is intended to be used in serverless and microservice environments and works with oth imperative and reactive programming paradigms. Its REST endpoints use JAX-RS, data models can be persisted using JPA, and CDI is used for dependency injection. Further, a large number of industry-standard libraries are supported like Vert.x, Hibernate, RESTEasy, Netty, Kubernetes, and Eclipse MicroProfile, just to name a few.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a simple REST endpoint using Java and Quarkus and how to secure it with OAuth 2.0 and Okta, a leading software-as-service identity management company.

This tutorial is a modified and updated version of the "Quarkus - Using JWT RBAC" tutorial on [the Quarkus website.](https://quarkus.io/guides/jwt-guide), the main difference being that this tutorial will use Okta as the OAuth provider and the OIDC Debugger to generate tokens for ad hoc testing (instead of rolling the whole thing yourself).

Let's get started!

## Install Quarkus Tutorial Prerequisites

You'll need to install a few things before you get started.

**Java 11**: This project uses Java 11. OpenJDK 11 will work just as well. Instructions are found on the [OpenJDK website](https://openjdk.java.net/install/). OpenJDK can also be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Alternatively, [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) is another great option for installing and managing Java versions.

Just a hint, if you run `mvn -v`, you'll see your Maven version AND the Java version Maven is running on.

On my computer (a Mac), I was able to use the following command to set the shell in which Maven was running to Java 11: `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11)`.

**HTTPie**: This is a simple command-line utility for making HTTP requests. You'll use this to test the REST application. Check out [the installation instructions on their website](https://httpie.org/doc#installation).

**Okta Developer Account**: You'll be using Okta as an OAuth/OIDC provider to add JWT authentication and authorization to the application. Go to [our developer site](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) and sign up for a free developer account.

## Create a Java Quarkus Project

Open a terminal and `cd` to an appropriate parent directory for your project. The command below uses the `quarkus-maven-plugin` to create a starter application and places it in the `oauthdemo` subdirectory.

```bash
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:1.11.1.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.okta.quarkus \
    -DprojectArtifactId=oauthdemo \
    -DclassName="com.okta.quarkus.jwt.TokenSecuredResource" \
    -Dpath="/secured" \
    -Dextensions="resteasy-jsonb, smallrye-jwt"
```

If you run the project at this point, you'll get an error because you need to define some application properties first.

## Configure Quarkus Application Properties

Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file and copy and paste the following into it. 

```properties
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/keys
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
```

You'll need to fill in your Okta developer URI in two places. 

To find your developer URI, open your Okta developer dashboard and navigate to **API** > **Authorization Servers**. Look at the row for the `default` auth server where you'll see the **Issuer URI**. 

That domain is your Okta URI that you'll need to populate in place of `{yourOktaDomain}`.

## Test the Default Quarkus Endpoint

Navigate into the project directory: `cd oauthdemo`.

Run the project:

```bash
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

You should see output like this:

```bash
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO]
[INFO] ---------------------< com.okta.quarkus:oauthdemo >---------------------

```

If you get an error, first check which version of java Maven is using. 

```bash
./mvnw -v
```

Now, in another terminal window, use HTTPie to test the generated endpoint:

```bash
$ http :8080/secured

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 5
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8

hello

```

Pretty sweet! But we can do a little better. 

Replace the `src/main/java/com/okta/quarkus/jwt/TokenSecuredResource.java` file with the following:

```java
package com.okta.quarkus.jwt;  
  
import java.security.Principal;  
  
import javax.annotation.security.PermitAll;  
import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;  
import javax.inject.Inject;  
import javax.ws.rs.GET;  
import javax.ws.rs.Path;  
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;  
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;  
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;  
import javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext;  
  
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;  
  
/**  
 * Version 1 of the TokenSecuredResource 
 */
@Path("/secured")  
@RequestScoped  
public class TokenSecuredResource {  
  
    @Inject  
    JsonWebToken jwt;  
  
    @GET()  
    @Path("/permit-all")  
    @PermitAll  
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)  
    public String hello(@Context SecurityContext ctx) {  
        Principal caller =  ctx.getUserPrincipal();  
        String name = caller == null ? "anonymous" : caller.getName();  
        boolean hasJWT = jwt != null;  
        String helloReply = String.format("hello + %s, isSecure: %s, authScheme: %s, hasJWT: %s", name, ctx.isSecure(), ctx.getAuthenticationScheme(), hasJWT);  
        return helloReply;  
    }  
      
}
```


Now save the file and test the new, updated endpoint:

```bash
$ http :8080/secured/permit-all

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

hello + anonymous, isSecure: false, authScheme: null, hasJWT: true

```

Did you notice how you didn't need to re-start or re-compile your application for the new endpoint to work? That's one of the slickest features of Quarkus!

Next, we'll add OAuth 2.0 support to the application. 

## Create an OIDC Application in Okta to Test Your Quarkus Service

Head over to your Okta developer dashboard - if this is your first time logging in, you may need to click the **Admin** button.

From the top menu, click on the  **Application** button and then click **Add Application**.

Select application type **Web** and click **Next**.

Give the app a name. I named mine "Quarkus Demo".

Under  **Login redirect URIs**, add a new URI: `https://oidcdebugger.com/debug`.

Under **Grant types allowed**, check **Implicit (Hybrid)**.

The rest of the default values will work.

Click  **Done**.

Leave the page open or take note of the  **Client ID**. You'll need it in a bit when you generate a token.

## Add Groups Claims To Default Authorization Server

You're going to add a **groups** claim mappings in the JWT access token, this is what maps Okta's groups to the role-based authorization in Quarkus.

From the top menu of the Okta developer dashboard, go to **API** and select **Authorization Servers**.

Click on the **default** server.

Select the **Claims** tab.

Click **Add Claim**.

- **Name**: `groups`
- **Include in token type**: `Access Token` `Always`
- **Value type**: `Groups`
- **Filter**: `Matches regex` `.*`

Click **Create**.

{% img blog/java-quarkus-oidc/add-groups-claim.png alt:"Add Groups Claim" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

## Update TokenSecuredResource

Now update the `TokenSecuredResource` class to do two things: 

1) Use CDI dependency injection to inject the `groups` claim from the JWT, if it's available2) Add a default endpoint for the `/secured` path that is protected by OAuth 2.0 and requires the `Everyone` group to access.

Change `TokenSecuredResource.java` to the following:

```java
package com.okta.quarkus.jwt;  
  
import java.security.Principal;  
import java.util.Set;  
  
import javax.annotation.security.PermitAll;  
import javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;  
import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;  
import javax.inject.Inject;  
import javax.ws.rs.GET;  
import javax.ws.rs.Path;  
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;  
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;  
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;  
import javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext;  
  
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.Claim;  
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;  
  
/**  
 * Version 1 of the TokenSecuredResource */
@Path("/secured")  
@RequestScoped  
public class TokenSecuredResource {  
  
    @Inject  
    JsonWebToken jwt;  
  
    @Inject  
    @Claim("groups")  
    Set<String> groups;  
  
    @GET()  
    @Path("permit-all")  
    @PermitAll  
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)  
    public String hello(@Context SecurityContext ctx) {  
        Principal caller =  ctx.getUserPrincipal();  
        String name = caller == null ? "anonymous" : caller.getName();  
        boolean hasJWT = jwt != null;  
        String groupsString = groups != null ? groups.toString() : "";  
        String helloReply = String.format("hello + %s, isSecure: %s, authScheme: %s, hasJWT: %s, groups: %s", name, ctx.isSecure(), ctx.getAuthenticationScheme(), hasJWT, groupsString);  
        return helloReply;  
    }  
  
    @GET()  
    @Path("/")  
    @RolesAllowed({"Everyone"})  
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)  
    public String helloRolesAllowed(@Context SecurityContext ctx) {  
        Principal caller =  ctx.getUserPrincipal();  
        String name = caller == null ? "anonymous" : caller.getName();  
        boolean hasJWT = jwt != null;  
        String groupsString = groups != null ? groups.toString() : "";  
        String helloReply = String.format("hello + %s, isSecure: %s, authScheme: %s, hasJWT: %s, groups: %s\"", name, ctx.isSecure(), ctx.getAuthenticationScheme(), hasJWT, groupsString);  
        return helloReply;  
    }  
}
```


Try out the new default endpoint:

```bash
$ http :8080/secured

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
...

Not authorized

```

## Generate an OAuth 2.0 Access Token to Test Authentication in Quarkus

Open the [OpenID Connect Debugger](https://oidcdebugger.com/). You're going to use this page to generate a JWT access token that you can use to authenticate.

{% img blog/java-quarkus-oidc/oidc-debugger.png alt:"OIDC Debugger" width:"650" %}{: .center-image }

Follow the below steps to continue:

1. Set the **Authorize URI** to: `https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize`
2. Copy your **Client ID** from the Okta OIDC application you created above and fill it in under **Client ID**
3. Change the scope to be `openid email profile`
4. Add something for **State**. It doesn't matter what. Just can't be blank
5. Scroll down. Click **Send**
6. Copy the resulting JWT Access Token to the clipboard, and in the terminal where you are running your HTTPie commands, save the token value to a shell variable, like so:

```bash
TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJxMm5rZmtwUDRhMlJLV2REU2JfQ...
```

## Test the JWT with the Protected Quarkus Endpoint

Now that you have a valid JWT from your OAuth provider (Okta), you should be able to use this JWT to authenticate against the protected endpoint.

Try it out:

```bash
http :8080/secured "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

You should see something like:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 123
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8

hello + andrew@gmail.com, isSecure: false, authScheme: MP-JWT, hasJWT: true, groups: [Everyone, Admin]"
```

## Add Functionality to Quarkus REST Endpoint

The first step to building a more realistic REST resource is to create a data model class. To do this, you can use a helper project called Lombok (more on [their website](https://projectlombok.org/)). 

To work with Lombok, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`. 

 ```xml
 <dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
    <version>1.18.16</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
 ```

**NOTE:** If you're using an IDE to build your project, and not the command line, install the Lombok plugin for it. For example, see the [Lombok IntelliJ plugin](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij).

You're only going to use a small part of Lombok, the `@Data` annotation, to save time writing boilerplate code in the data model class (check out [the annotation docs](https://projectlombok.org/features/Data), if you like). It generates getters, setters, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` methods.

Go ahead and create a java class: `src/main/java/com/okta/quarkus/jwt/Kayak.java`.

```java
package com.okta.quarkus.jwt;  
  
import lombok.Data;  
  
import java.util.Objects;  
  
@Data  
public class Kayak {  
  
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private Integer length;  
  
    public Kayak() {  
    }  
  
    public Kayak(String make, String model, Integer length) {  
        this.make = make;  
        this.model = model;  
        this.length = length;  
    }       
}
```

You may have guessed by now that your new REST endpoint is going to manage a list of kayaks.

> This code is pure JAX-RS and is not specific to working with Quarkus or Kubernetes. JAX-RS is the Java API for Restful Web Services, an annotation-based specification for configuring REST services. Because it's just a spec, the actual implementation is provided by the Quarkus stack.

Now you need to create the REST endpoint resource: 
`src/main/java/com/okta/quarkus/jwt/KayakResource.java`.

```java
package com.okta.quarkus.jwt;  
  
import java.util.Collections;  
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;  
import java.util.Set;  
  
import javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;  
import javax.ws.rs.Consumes;  
import javax.ws.rs.DELETE;  
import javax.ws.rs.GET;  
import javax.ws.rs.POST;  
import javax.ws.rs.Path;  
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;  
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;  
  
@Path("/kayaks")  
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)  
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)  
public class KayakResource {  
  
    private Set<Kayak> kayaks = Collections.newSetFromMap(Collections.synchronizedMap(new LinkedHashMap<>()));  
  
    public KayakResource() {  
        kayaks.add(new Kayak("NDK", "Romany", 17));  
        kayaks.add(new Kayak("NDK", "Surf", 16));  
        kayaks.add(new Kayak("P&H", "Scorpio HV", 15));  
    }  
  
    @GET  
    public Set<Kayak> list() {  
        return kayaks;  
    }  
  
    @RolesAllowed({"Everyone"})  
    @POST  
    public Set<Kayak> add(Kayak kayak) {  
        kayaks.add(kayak);  
        return kayaks;  
    }  
  
    @RolesAllowed({"Everyone"})  
    @DELETE  
    public Set<Kayak> delete(Kayak kayak) {  
        kayaks.remove(kayak);  
        return kayaks;  
    }  
}
```

I won't go into a ton of detail here, but I do want to point out a few things. First, notice the `@Produces` and `@Consumes` annotations. The Quarkus docs state that it is very important to include these as they're used to optimize the final build. This endpoint uses JSON, specified by the constant `MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON`.

Also, notice that the GET endpoint is public, but the POST and DELETE endpoints require membership in the `Everyone` group. Don't confuse `Everyone` with anonymous. `Everyone` is a catch-all, default group assigned to anyone that authenticates on the Okta OIDC application. In this instance, it means that a user has authenticated but isn't necessarily part of any other group, such as `Admin`. 

## Test Your Quarkus Endpoint and Add a New Kayak

Since you added a new dependency to your `pom.xml`, you'll need to restart the Maven process running your server.

Then, test the POST endpoint without a token to verify that it's protected.

```bash
$ http POST :8080/kayaks make="P&H" model="Cetus HV" length=18

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
...

Not authorized

```

Now, try again with the token. You'll see that a new kayak has been added to the list!

```bash
$ http POST :8080/kayaks make="P&H" model="Cetus HV" length=18 "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
...

[
    {
        "length": 17,
        "make": "NDK",
        "model": "Romany"
    },
    {
        "length": 16,
        "make": "NDK",
        "model": "Surf"
    },
    {
        "length": 15,
        "make": "P&H",
        "model": "Scorpio HV"
    },
    {
        "length": 18,
        "make": "P&H",
        "model": "Cetus HV"
    }
]
```

You can delete the newly added kayak with the following command:

```bash
http DELETE :8080/kayaks make="P&H" model="Cetus HV" length=18 "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

You might notice there's no PUT (update) in this service. In a more complete service, each record would have a unique ID of some type associated with it. This would allow a client app to specify a specific record for update and deletion (instead of using the record properties themselves and the `equals()` method).

Also, clearly this resource is pretty naive, storing the data in a class property. In a real application, JPA annotations could be used to map the data model to a database for easy serialization and deserialization.

## Learn More about Java, Quarkus, and Token Authentication

All done! In this tutorial, you used Quarkus and Java to create a simple REST service, secured with JWT OAuth using Okta as an OAuth/OIDC provider. You also saw how to use CDI dependency injection to inspect JWT claims and retrieve information about the authenticated (or not) client. Finally, you tried some of the basics of RBAC (role-based authentication).

As a reminder, this tutorial was inspired by the Quarkus post: [Using JWT RBAC](https://quarkus.io/guides/jwt-guide.html).

Quarkus has a ton of [other great guides on their website](https://quarkus.io/guides/).
