Laravel is one of the hottest frameworks for backend and full-stack development of Web applications today. It boasts a large number of quality features out-of-the-box, but it's still easy to learn the basics. The community is vast, and there are tons of free resources available on the Internet.

This sample application will use Postgres as the backend database system, Okta for user authentication, and Heroku for quick deployment to a scalable platform. Heroku is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that allows you to get started and go live faster because it handles the underlying infrastructure automatically. It also helps your application grow elastically by managing the available resources according to the load. Heroku is also probably the cheapest option for low-traffic sites – you can't beat free!

You'll need PHP, Composer, and Postgres. You will also need an [Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/) and a [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) – you can sign up for free on both sites.

## Okta For Identity Management

Okta is an API Identity service that allows you to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or more applications. We might be biased, but we think Okta makes [identity management](https://developer.okta.com/product/user-management/) easier, more secure, and more scalable than what you're used to.

To complete this tutorial, you'll need to [register for a forever-free developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/). 

## MySQL and PostgreSQL - Choose the Right Database for Your Project

We just published [an overview on the tradeoffs between MySQL and PostgreSQL](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/07/19/mysql-vs-postgres) that covers many of the factors in choosing a database. Check it out for an in-depth review, but here are the highlights:

* Performance - modern versions and engines have created performance parity between the two databases. Performance tradeoffs should not be a deciding factor for most applications.
* Concurrency - PostgreSQL handles concurrency better than MySQL
* Default installation is cleaner with Postgres, and it's more extensible, supporting more datatypes, operators, and index types
* MySQL is faster for simple, read-heavy workflows and may require less memory to run
* Postgres is a newer technology with a smaller community, but a better commitment to open source than MySQL

We chose Postgres for this tutorial because many of our customers use it for their products.

## Bootstrapping a Laravel/Postgres Project with Authentication Scaffolding

Laravel supports Postgres out-of-the-box (although it suggests MySQL in its example configuration). In this section, you'll start a new Laravel project with the Authentication scaffolding. Then you'll configure it to use Postgres as a data store.

The tutorial assumes your development environment already has PHP, Composer, and Postgres. If you need help setting up Postgres for your platform, please refer to its documentation.

Start by creating a new Postgres database and granting access to it:

```bash
psql
create database laravel;
create user laravel with encrypted password 'laravel';
grant all privileges on database laravel to laravel;
```

Create a new Laravel project:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
laravel new okta-laravel-pg-demo && cd okta-laravel-pg-demo
```

Add the authentication scaffolding and pull the [Laravel Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/master/socialite) and [SocialiteProviders/Okta](https://socialiteproviders.netlify.com/providers/okta.html) packages (you'll need these when switching the authentication method from a local database to Okta):

```bash
php artisan make:auth
composer require laravel/socialite socialiteproviders/okta
```

## Create an Okta Account and Application

Before you proceed, you need to log into your Okta account (or [create a new one for free](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)) and create an OAuth application. You'll need to get a client ID and a client secret for your application.

Start by going  to the Applications menu item and click the **Add Application** button:

{% img blog/laravel-postgres/image4.png alt:"Add Application button" width:"300" %}{: .center-image }

Select **Web** and click **Next**.

{% img blog/laravel-postgres/image1.png alt:"Select Web from the list of application types" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Enter a title, and set http://localhost:8000/ as the Initiate Login URI and http://localhost:8000/login/okta/callback as the Login Redirect URI, then click Done. You can leave the rest of the settings as they are.

Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values from the application settings. Go to **Api > Authorization Servers**, and copy just the host name part of the the `Issuer URI` field (without the `/oauth2/default` part) - this is your Okta Base URL (it looks like `https://{{yourOktaDomain}}` but the numbers may be different in your case).

## Configuring Okta and the Database in Your Application

Edit `.env.example`, add the following:

```
OKTA_CLIENT_ID=
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=
OKTA_BASE_URL=
OKTA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/login/okta/callback
```

Edit `.env`, configure your database, add the Okta keys and input the values you copied in the previous section:

```
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=laravel
DB_PASSWORD=laravel

OKTA_CLIENT_ID=
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=
OKTA_BASE_URL=
OKTA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/login/okta/callback
```

Before running the database migrations, make some changes:

Delete `database/migrations/2014_10_12_100000_create_password_resets_table.php file` (you won't need to handle password resets for your users after switching to Okta authentication).

Replace `database/migrations/2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table.php` with:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class CreateUsersTable extends Migration
{
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->bigIncrements('id');
            $table->string('email')->unique();
            $table->text('token');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('users');
    }
}
```

You only need to store an email and a token (both received from Okta after successful authentication) for each user in your database.

It's necessary to edit the User model as well. Replace `app/User.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Notifiable;

    /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $fillable = [
        'email', 'token'
    ];

}
```

Run the database migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
Migration table created successfully.
Migrating: 2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table
Migrated:  2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table
```

Open psql (the Postgres command-line tool) and confirm there are two tables (`migrations` and `users`):

```bash
psql laravel
laravel=# \dt
           List of relations
 Schema |    Name    | Type  |  Owner
--------+------------+-------+---------
 public | migrations | table | laravel
 public | users      | table | laravel
(2 rows)

laravel=# \q
```

## Configuring Socialite for Okta Authentication

If you run `php artisan serve` and load `http://localhost:8000/` you should see the default Laravel application with Login / Register links in the top right corner. However, it still uses the local database to authenticate users. In this section, you'll switch the application to Okta authentication.

Configure the Socialite provider:

Add to the `$providers` array in `config/app.php`:

```php
$providers = [
    ...
    \SocialiteProviders\Manager\ServiceProvider::class,
    ...    
]
```

Add to the `$listen` array in `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php`:

```php
protected $listen = [
    ...
    \SocialiteProviders\Manager\SocialiteWasCalled::class => [
        'SocialiteProviders\\Okta\\OktaExtendSocialite@handle',
    ],
    ...
];
```

Add to `config/services.php`:

```php
'okta' => [
    'client_id' => env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'),
    'client_secret' => env('OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET'),
    'redirect' => env('OKTA_REDIRECT_URI'),
    'base_url' => env('OKTA_BASE_URL')
],
```

Add to `routes/web.php`:

```php
Route::get('login/okta', 'Auth\LoginController@redirectToProvider')->name('login-okta');
Route::get('login/okta/callback', 'Auth\LoginController@handleProviderCallback');
```

Replace `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php` with:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers\Auth;

use App\User;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Socialite;

class LoginController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Redirect the user to the GitHub authentication page.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function redirectToProvider()
    {
        return Socialite::driver('okta')->redirect();
    }

    /**
     * Obtain the user information from GitHub.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function handleProviderCallback(\Illuminate\Http\Request $request)
    {
        $user = Socialite::driver('okta')->user();

        $email = $user->email;
        $token = $user->token;

        $localUser = User::where('email', $email)->first();

        // create a local user with the email and token from Okta
        if (! $localUser) {
            $localUser = User::create([  
                'email' => $email,
                'token' => $token,
            ]);
        } else {

            // if the user already exists, just update the token:
            $localUser->token = $token;
            $localUser->save();
        }

        Auth::login($localUser);

        return redirect('/home');
    }

    public function logout()
    {
        Auth::logout();

        return redirect('/');
    }
}
```

Modify the section of `resources/views/welcome.php` that displays the top right menu:

{%raw%}
```php
@if (Route::has('login'))
    <div class="top-right links">
        @auth
            <a href="{{ url('/home') }}">Home</a>
        @else
            <a href="{{ url('/login/okta') }}">Log in with Okta</a>
        @endauth
    </div>
@endif
```

Modify `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`, replace
`{{ Auth::user()->name }}` with `{{ Auth::user()->email }}`

Update `app/Http/Middleware/Authenticate.php`, replace 
`return route('login');` with `return route('login-okta');`
{%endraw%}

Phew, that was a lot of changes! Run the development web server again:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Load `http://localhost:8000`. Click **Login with Okta** and after a successful login you will see the dashboard and the Okta email as your login identifier in the top right corner.

## Create a Heroku Account

In the last part of the tutorial, you'll deploy the application to Heroku. Before proceeding, head straight to [Heroku signup](https://signup.heroku.com/) and create a new free account.

Install the Heroku command-line interface (CLI), verify the installation and login. Refer to the Heroku documentation on how to do this on your platform (Windows or Linux). Here are the steps for MacOS:

```bash
brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
heroku --version
heroku/7.24.3 darwin-x64 node-v11.14.0
heroku login
```

Then initialize a new heroku app inside your project directory (`okta-laravel-pg-demo`):

```bash
heroku create
Creating app... done, ⬢ warm-bastion-91341
https://warm-bastion-91341.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/warm-bastion-91341.git
```

The application ID will differ, but make a note of it. It's a part of the deployment URL of your application (in this example, it's https://warm-bastion-91341.herokuapp.com/).

Head to Okta, edit your application and replace `http://localhost:8000/` with your deployment URL. Using the example above, you would set:

```
Login redirect URIs: https://warm-bastion-91341.herokuapp.com/login/okta/callback
Initiate login URI: https://warm-bastion-91341.herokuapp.com/
```

Of course, use your own domain name.

## Deploy the Application to Heroku

These deployment instructions are largely based on the [Heroku Laravel Guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-laravel).

Create a `Procfile` first to define the correct document root (`/public`) for your Laravel app:

```bash
echo "web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 public/" > Procfile
```

The project needs to be a git repo in order to deploy it to Heroku. Initialize a new git repo in this folder, and add all the current files:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "new laravel project"
```

Then set the Okta keys you want to use (make sure to replace the callback URL with the new heroku deployment URL):

```bash
heroku config:set APP_KEY=$(php artisan --no-ansi key:generate --show)
heroku config:set OKTA_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR OKTA CLIENT ID>
heroku config:set OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR OKTA CLIENT SECRET>
heroku config:set OKTA_BASE_URL=<YOUR OKTA BASE URL>
heroku config:set OKTA_REDIRECT_URI=<YOUR HEROKU URL>/login/okta/callback
heroku config:set DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
```

Go to [dashboard.heroku.com/apps](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), then click on your app, click **Resources** and in the **Add-ons** section find Postgres:

{% img blog/laravel-postgres/image2.png alt:"Screenshot of Heroku admin dashboard" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Select the **Hobby Dev - Free** plan and provision it for your app:

{% img blog/laravel-postgres/image3.png alt:"Choose the Hobby Dev plan" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }

Heroku provides a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable that you can parse to extract the database credentials. Update `config/database.php`:

```php

$DATABASE_URL = parse_url(getenv("DATABASE_URL"));

return [
    // ...
    'connections' => [
        // ...
        'pgsql' => [
            'driver' => 'pgsql',
            'host' => env('DB_HOST') ?? $DATABASE_URL["host"],
            'port' => env('DB_PORT') ?? $DATABASE_URL["port"],
            'database' => env('DB_DATABASE') ?? ltrim($DATABASE_URL["path"], "/"),
            'username' => env('DB_USERNAME') ?? $DATABASE_URL["user"],
            'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD') ?? $DATABASE_URL["pass"],
            'charset' => 'utf8',
            'prefix' => '',
            'schema' => 'public',
            'sslmode' => 'require',
        ],
        // ...
    ],
    // ...
];
```

The code uses the `DB_...` variables if available but if they are not set, it falls back to the `DATABASE_URL` parsing.

Commit your changes, deploy the application to Heroku and run the database migrations. Finally, open the application:

```bash
git commit -am 'updated database config'
git push heroku master
heroku run php artisan migrate
heroku open
```

The heroku deployment URL should open in a browser and you can test the Okta login. Well done!
