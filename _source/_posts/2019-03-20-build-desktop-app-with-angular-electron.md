So, you have been learning all about web technologies including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The advantage of web technologies is, of course, that the same software can be used on many different platforms. But this advantage comes with a number of problems. Web applications have to be run inside a browser and the interoperability with the operating system is limited. Direct access to features of the operating system is usually the domain for desktop applications. They run inside their own process and can easily be added to the dock or start menu. Wouldn't it be nice if you could develop a desktop application using the tools that you are comfortable with as a web developer? This is where Electron comes into play.

## What is Electron?

Electron is a JavaScript wrapper around a Chromium web browser. An Electron program consists of two independent JavaScript threads. An outer thread that runs within Node and has access to Node's operating system libraries, such as File System and Process libraries. Then there is a JavaScript thread that runs within the browser window. This thread has the usual restrictions of web applications. The outer thread and the browser thread can communicate via inter-process communication (IPC) functions provided by Electron. Chromium is an open source web browser that is developed by Google and provides the basis for the Chrome browser. It comes with a powerful JavaScript engine which makes it possible to run all types of modern web applications. You can think of an electron application just like a normal web application.

In this tutorial, I'll be showing you how to develop a desktop application using Electron and Angular. The application will be a simple image browser. Angular will be providing the user interface and processing the user interactions. The main process will be accessing the file system and reading directory contents. In addition, I will be showing you how to process authentication with Okta.

## Scaffold the Angular Electron App

I will start with the user interface. I will sometimes refer to this part of the application as the client because of its similarity to web client applications. You will hopefully be somewhat familiar with JavaScript and Node. I am assuming that you have already installed Node and the `npm` command line tool. The client will be based on Angular. To this end, you will also need the Angular command line tool. Open a terminal and enter the command:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@7.3.6
```

This will install the global `ng` command. If you are on a Unix-like system, Node installs global commands in a directory that is only writeable by super-users. In this case, you have to run the command above using `sudo`. To create a new Angular application, navigate to a directory of your choice and issue the following command.

```bash
ng new ImageBrowser --routing --style=css
```

This will create a directory `ImageBrowser` and initialize it with a base Angular application. To use the Electron library you will need to install it first. In the terminal navigate into the `ImageBrowser` directory and run this command.

```bash
npm install --save electron@4.1.0
```

## Build the Angular Application

The application will use a service that encapsulates the interprocess communication with the Node process. This service is created using the command line as follows.

```bash
ng generate service images
```

This should create a new file `src/app/images.service.ts`. Open this file and paste the following code into it.

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';
const electron = (<any>window).require('electron');

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ImagesService {
  images = new BehaviorSubject<string[]>([]);
  directory = new BehaviorSubject<string[]>([]);

  constructor() {
    electron.ipcRenderer.on('getImagesResponse', (event, images) => {
      this.images.next(images);
    });
    electron.ipcRenderer.on('getDirectoryResponse', (event, directory) => {
      this.directory.next(directory);
    });
  }

  navigateDirectory(path) {
    electron.ipcRenderer.send('navigateDirectory', path);
  }
}
```

The Electron browser library is imported using the somewhat strange looking require statement `const electron = (<any>window).require('electron');` Electron makes itself available to the browser side JavaScript through the `window` global variable. Since the TypeScript compiler is not aware of this, `window` has to be cast to `any` before accessing the `require` function. Electron provides the `ipcRenderer` object which implements interprocess communication for the renderer. `ipcRenderer.on` is used to register listeners for IPC messages. In this application, you are listening to `getImagesResponse` which will receive an array of image URLs and `getDirectoryResponse` which will receive an array of directory names. To send a request to the Node application to navigate to a different directory, `ipcRenderer.send` is used.

The `images` and `directory` arrays are sent to a `BehaviorSubject`. In this way, any updates can be picked up by an observer. These observers will be defined in the image browser component. Create this component by calling the `ng` command in the terminal.

```bash
ng generate component browser
```

Now, open `src/app/browser/browser.component.ts` and paste the code below into the file.

```ts
import { Component, OnInit, ChangeDetectorRef } from '@angular/core';
import { ImagesService } from '../images.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-browser',
  templateUrl: './browser.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./browser.component.css']
})
export class BrowserComponent implements OnInit {
  images: string[];
  directory: string[];

  constructor(private imageService: ImagesService, private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.imageService.images.subscribe((value) => {
      this.images = value;
      this.cdr.detectChanges();
    });

    this.imageService.directory.subscribe((value) => {
      this.directory = value;
      this.cdr.detectChanges();
    });
  }

  navigateDirectory(path) {
    this.imageService.navigateDirectory(path);
  }
}
```

The `BrowserComponent` subscribes to `images` and `directory` of the `ImagesService`. Note that the changes triggered by an Electron IPC call are not seen by Angular's change detection strategy. For this reason, a call to `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` is needed to tell Angular to update the view with any data changes that might have occurred. Next, open `src/app/browser/browser.component.html` and create the template for the browser component.

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="layout">
  <div class="navigator">
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let dir of directory">
        <a (click)="navigateDirectory(dir)">{{dir}}</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="thumbnails">
    <div *ngFor="let img of images" class="image">
      <img [src]="img">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}

This template simply displays a list of directories next to a grid of images. When a directory link is clicked, the application requests to navigate to that directory. The browser should also get some styling in `src/app/browser/browser.component.css`.

```css
.layout { display: flex; }

.navigator {
    width: 300px;
    overflow: auto;
    flex-grow: 0;
    flex-shrink: 0;
    border-right: 1px solid #EEEEEE;
}

.navigator ul { list-style: none; }

.navigator a {
  cursor: pointer;
  font-family: "Courier New", monospace;
  font-size: 14px;
}

.thumbnails {
    flex-grow: 1;
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.thumbnails .image {
    width: 25%;
    flex-shrink: 0;
    height: 200px;
    padding: 8px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.thumbnails img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
}
```

To show the browser component as the main component of the application modify `src/app/app-routing.module.ts` to import the component and include it as the main route in the `routes` array.

```ts
import { BrowserComponent } from './browser/browser.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: BrowserComponent }
];
```

Next, open `src/app/app.component.html` and delete everything except the router outlet.

```html
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

Finally, open `src/app/app.component.ts` and modify the contents to match the code below.

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ImagesService } from './images.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  title = 'Image Browser';

  constructor(private imageService: ImagesService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.imageService.navigateDirectory('.');
  }
}
```

The application component initializes the image service by loading the contents of the current directory. This completes the client part of the application. As you can see, it is a typical Angular application apart from the fact that the image service communicates via IPC calls. You could extend this application just like any other web application with multiple routes or HTTP calls to other web services.

## Create Your Electron Application

The Electron application will be placed into its own directory. For larger applications, you will probably keep the two parts of the application completely separate in different folders. For the sake of simplicity, in this tutorial, the Electron application will be implemented in a subdirectory of our application directory. Within the `ImageBrowser` directory, create a new directory `electron`. Copy the `tsconfig.json` from the Angular application into this directory. Open the new `tsconfig.json` and modify the output directory to `"outDir": "./dist"` and the module resolution to `"module": "commonjs"`. Also add the setting `"skipLibCheck": true`. Now create a new file `electron/main.ts` and paste the following code into it.

```ts
import { app, BrowserWindow, ipcMain } from "electron";
import * as path from "path";
import * as url from "url";
import * as fs from "fs";

let win: BrowserWindow;

function createWindow() {
  win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 });

  win.loadURL(
    url.format({
      pathname: path.join(__dirname, `/../../dist/ImageBrowser/index.html`),
      protocol: "file:",
      slashes: true
    })
  );

  win.webContents.openDevTools();

  win.on("closed", () => {
    win = null;
  });
}

app.on("ready", createWindow);

app.on("activate", () => {
  if (win === null) {
    createWindow();
  }
});

// Quit when all windows are closed.
app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
  // On macOS it is common for applications and their menu bar
  // to stay active until the user quits explicitly with Cmd + Q
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
    app.quit()
  }
});

function getImages() {
  const cwd = process.cwd();
  fs.readdir('.', {withFileTypes: true}, (err, files) => {
      if (!err) {
          const re = /(?:\.([^.]+))?$/;
          const images = files
            .filter(file => file.isFile() && ['jpg', 'png'].includes(re.exec(file.name)[1]))
            .map(file => `file://${cwd}/${file.name}`);
          win.webContents.send("getImagesResponse", images);
      }
  });
}

function isRoot() {
    return path.parse(process.cwd()).root == process.cwd();
}

function getDirectory() {
  fs.readdir('.', {withFileTypes: true}, (err, files) => {
      if (!err) {
          const directories = files
            .filter(file => file.isDirectory())
            .map(file => file.name);
          if (!isRoot()) {
              directories.unshift('..');
          }
          win.webContents.send("getDirectoryResponse", directories);
      }
  });
}

ipcMain.on("navigateDirectory", (event, path) => {
  process.chdir(path);
  getImages();
  getDirectory();
});
```

Don't be intimidated by the amount of content you see here. I will talk you through this file step by step. 

At the top of the file, a global variable `win` is declared. In the following function `createWindow()`, this variable is assigned a new `BrowserWindow`. `BrowserWindow` is Electron's application window. It is called Browser Window because it really is a simple Chromium browser that will host your Angular application. After `win` is created, content is loaded into it with `win.loadURL()`. The path should point to the `index.html` of compiled Angular app.

The line `win.webContents.openDevTools()` opens the developer tools inside Chromium. This should be used for development only. But it allows you to use the full set of developer tools that you are probably familiar with from the Chrome browser.

Next, an event handler is added to the window that is activated when the window is closed, setting the `win` variable to `null`. Later on, when the application is activated again, `win` can be checked and a new window can be created. This is done in the `app.on("activate", ...)` handler.

The `createWindow` function is registered with the `ready` event by calling `app.on("ready", createWindow)`. The `window-all-closed` event signals that all windows are closed. On most platforms, this should terminate the application. However, on macOS closing the window does not normally terminate the application.

Two functions `getImages` and `getDirectory` perform similar operations. They both read the current directory and filter its contents. `getImages` selects all files ending in `.png` or `.jpg` and construct a full URL for each file. It then sends the result to the `getImagesResponse` IPC channel. This will be received by the `ImagesService` of the Angular part of the application. `getDirectory` is very similar but it selects only directories and sends the result to `getDirectoryResponse`. Note that the file system's `fs.readdir` does not return an entry for the parent directory. So when the current directory is not the root directory, the `..` entry is manually added to the list.

Finally, an IPC listener is added that listens to the `navigateDirectory` event. This listener changes the current directory and then retrieves all images and directories from the new directory.

To run the full application, you can add the following script to your `package.json`.

```json
"electron": "ng build --base-href ./ && tsc --p electron && electron electron/dist/main.js"
```

This script first builds the Angular application, then the Electron application and finally starts electron. You can run it by calling this command.

```bash
npm run electron
```

If you did everything right, the application should compile and then you should see a window popping up that lets you browse directories and view the images in them.

## Add Authentication to Your Angular Electron Desktop App

You may want to restrict access to your desktop application to users that are registered. Okta allows you to quickly set up secure authentication with full user control. This means that you can freely decide who can use your application and who can't.

{% include setup/cli.md type="native" loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:8000" logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:8000" %}

I will be using the AppAuth library from Google which allows authentication through OIDC and OAuth 2.0. You can install the library with the following command.

```bash
npm install --save @openid/appauth@1.2.2
```

Google provides an example on how to integrate AppAuth with Electron. To make your life simple, you can use the authentication flow for the purpose of your own application. Copy the contents of the example [`flow.ts`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googlesamples/appauth-js-electron-sample/master/flow.ts) into a `flow.ts` file in your `electron` folder. Near the top of the file, find the following lines.

```ts
/* an example open id connect provider */
const openIdConnectUrl = "https://accounts.google.com";

/* example client configuration */
const clientId =
  "511828570984-7nmej36h9j2tebiqmpqh835naet4vci4.apps.googleusercontent.com";
const redirectUri = "http://127.0.0.1:8000";
const scope = "openid";
```

Replace them with this content.

```ts
const openIdConnectUrl = 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default';
const clientId = '{yourClientId}';
const redirectUri = 'http://localhost:8000';
const scope = 'openid profile offline_access';
```

To keep the example minimal, replace the import of the logger, `import { log } from "./logger";` with  `const log = console.log;`. Now, open `electron/main.ts` again. At the top of the file, import some classes from `flow.ts`.

```ts
import { AuthFlow, AuthStateEmitter } from './flow';
```

Then, at the bottom of the same file add the following snippet.

```ts
const authFlow = new AuthFlow();

authFlow.authStateEmitter.on(
    AuthStateEmitter.ON_TOKEN_RESPONSE, createWindow
);

async function signIn() {
  if (!authFlow.loggedIn()) {
    await authFlow.fetchServiceConfiguration();
    await authFlow.makeAuthorizationRequest();
  }
}
```

The function `signIn()` will check if the user is logged in and, if not, make an authorization request. The `authStateEmitter` will receive an `ON_TOKEN_RESPONSE` when the user is successfully logged in. It will then call `createWindow` to start the application. In order to call the `signIn` method, change the handler for the application's `ready` event to the following.

```ts
app.on('ready', signIn);
```

Give it a try and run the following command.

```bash
npm run electron
```

Your default web browser should open up and request you to log into your Okta account. Once successfully logged in the Image Browser application will open up.

## Learn More About Angular and Electron

In this tutorial, I have shown you how to create a desktop application with Angular and Electron. Authentication control with Okta has been added using Google's AppAuth library. Electron makes it straightforward to use current web technologies and create native desktop applications. Electron uses the Chromium browser to run a web client. The browser is controlled by a Node process. To learn more about Electron, Angular and authentication, why not check out one of the following links.
