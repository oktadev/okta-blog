React Native is a framework for building mobile applications with React. React allows you to use a declarative style of programming to describe how your UI should look. It uses embedded HTML (called JSX) to render buttons, lists, scrollable views, and many other components.

I'm a seasoned Java and JavaScript developer that loves Spring and TypeScript. Some might call me a Java hipster because I like JavaScript. In this post, I'm going to show you how to build a Spring Boot API that talks to a PostgreSQL database. You'll use Elasticsearch to make your data searchable. You'll also learn how to deploy it to Cloud Foundry, and Google Cloud Platform using Kubernetes.

The _really cool_ part is you'll see how to build a mobile app with React Native. React Native allows you to build mobile apps with the web technologies you know and love: React and JavaScript! I'll show you how to test it on device emulators and deploy it to your phone. _Giddyup!_

== Create a Spring Boot App

In my recent developer life, I built an app to help me track and monitor my health. I came up with the idea while writing the http://www.jhipster-book.com[JHipster Mini-Book]. I was inspired by Spring Boot's Actuator, which helps you monitor the health of your Spring Boot app. The app is called 21-Points Health and you can https://github.com/mraible/21-points[find its source code on GitHub].

21-Points Health uses a 21-point system to see how healthy you are being each week. Its rules are simple: you can earn up to three points per day for the following reasons:

. If you eat healthy, you get a point. Otherwise, zero.
. If you exercise, you get a point.
. If you don't drink alcohol, you get a point.

I'm going to cheat a bit in this tutorial. Rather than writing every component line-by-line, I'm going to _generate_ the API and the app using JHipster and Ignite JHipster.

=== What is JHipster?

I'm glad you asked! It's an Apache-licensed open source project that allows you to generate Spring Boot APIs, as well as Angular or React UIs. It includes support for generating CRUD screens and adding all the necessary plumbing. It even generates microservice architectures!

Ignite JHipster is a complementary feature of JHipster. It's a blueprint template for the Ignite CLI project. https://infinite.red/ignite[Ignite CLI] is open source and MIT licensed, produced by the good folks at https://infinite.red/[Infinite Red]. Ignite CLI allows you to generate React Native apps in seconds with a number of components pre-integrated. I was blown away the first time I saw a demo of it from https://twitter.com/GantLaborde[Gant Laborde].

To get things moving quickly, I ran `jhipster export-jdl` to export an entity definition from 21-Points Health. After exporting the entity definitions, I used https://start.jhipster.tech/jdl-studio[JDL-Studio] to create an application definition for my project. Then I clicked the download icon to save the file to my hard drive.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/jdl-studio.png' %}[alt=JDL-Studio,width=800,align=center]

The code you see below is called JDL, or JHipster Domain Language. It was initially designed for JHipster to allow multiple entities and specifying all their attributes, relationships, and pagination features. It's recently been enhanced to allow generating whole apps from a single file! üí•

----

Create a new directory, with a `jhipster-api` directory inside it.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p react-native-spring-boot/jhipster-api
----

Copy the JDL above into an `app.jh` file inside the `react-native-spring-boot` directory. Install JHipster using npm.

[source,bash]
----
npm i -g generator-jhipster@5.8.0
----

Navigate to the `jhipster-api` directory in a terminal window. Run the command below to generate an app with a plethora of useful features out-of-the-box.

[source,bash]
----
jhipster import-jdl ../app.jh
----

== Run Your Spring Boot App

This app has a number of technologies and features specified as part of its application configuration, including OIDC auth, PostgreSQL, Gradle, Elasticsearch, Protractor tests, React, and Sass. Not only that, it even has test coverage for most of its code!

To make sure your app is functional, start a few Docker containers for Elasticsearch, Keycloak, PostgreSQL, and Sonar. The commands below should be run from the `jhipster-api` directory.

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/elasticsearch.yml up -d
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
----

_The containers might take a bit to download, so you might want to grab a coffee, or a glass of water._

While you're waiting, you can also commit your project to Git. If you have Git installed, JHipster will run `git init` in your `jhipster-api` directory. Since you're putting your Spring Boot app and React Native app in the same repository, remove `.git` from `jhipster-api` and initialize Git in the parent directory.

[source,bash]
----
rm -rf jhipster-api/.git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Generate Spring Boot API"
----

== Ensure Test Coverage with Sonar

JHipster generates apps with high https://www.jhipster.tech/code-quality/[code quality]. Code quality is analyzed using https://sonarcloud.io/[SonarCloud], which is automatically configured by JHipster. The "code quality" metric is determined by the percentage of code that is covered by tests.

Once all the Docker containers have finished starting, run the following command to prove code quality is üëç (from the `jhipster-api` directory).

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -Pprod clean test sonarqube
----

Once this process completes, an analysis of your project will be available on the Sonar dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:9001`. Check it - you have a triple-A-rated app! Not bad, eh?

image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/sonar.png' %}[alt=Sonar AAA,width=800,align=center]

== Create a React Native App for Your Spring Boot API

You can build a React Native app for your Spring Boot API using https://github.com/ruddell/ignite-jhipster[Ignite JHipster], created by https://twitter.com/ruddell[Jon Ruddell]. Jon is one of the most prolific https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/graphs/contributors[JHipster contributors]. ‚ù§Ô∏è

image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/ignite-jhipster.png' %}[alt=Ignite JHipster,width=369,align=center]

Install Ignite CLI:

[source,bash]
----
npm i -g ignite-cli@2.2.2 ignite-jhipster@2.0.3
----

Make sure you're in the `react-native-spring-boot` directory, then generate a React Native app.

[source,bash]
----
ignite new HealthPoints -b ignite-jhipster
----

When prompted for the path to your JHipster project, enter `jhipster-api`. Accept the default answers for end-to-end tests with Detox and statistics (if prompted).

When the project is finished generating, rename `HealthPoints` to `react-native-app`, then committed it to Git.

[source,bash]
----
mv HealthPoints react-native-app
rm -rf react-native-app/.git
git add .
git commit -m "Add React Native app"
----

You might notice that two new files were added to your API project.

[source,bash]
----
create mode 100644 jhipster-api/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/config/ResourceServerConfiguration.java
create mode 100644 jhipster-api/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/web/rest/AuthInfoResource.java
----

These classes configure a resource server for your project (so you can pass in an `Authorization` header with an access token) and expose the OIDC issuer and client ID via a REST endpoint.

Ignite JHipster also adds your app's URL scheme, `healthpoints://*`, to `src/main/docker/realm-config/jhipster-realm.json`. This configures Keycloak so it will allow access from your app.

== Modify React Native App for OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Login

Ignite JHipster automatically configures your React Native app so OIDC login works. You can see the https://github.com/ruddell/ignite-jhipster/blob/master/docs/oauth2-oidc.md[details in its documentation]. You will need to restart Keycloak for this configuration to take effect.

----
docker-compose -f jhipster-api/src/main/docker/keycloak.yml restart
----

== Run Your React Native App on iOS

To run your React Native app, you'll need to start your Spring Boot app first. Navigate to the `jhipster-api` directory and run `./gradlew`. In another terminal window, navigate to `react-native-app/ios` and run `pod install`. Then navigate up a directory and run `react-native run-ios`.

Verify you can log in by clicking the hamburger menu in the top left corner, then **Login**. Use "admin" for the username and password. You'll know you logged in successfully if you click on the menu again and see **Entities** and **Logout** options.

// image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/ignite-login-menu.png' %}[alt=Login Menu,width=300,role=pull-left]
// image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/keycloak-login.png' %}[alt=Keycloak Login,width=300,role=pull-left]
// image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/menu-with-entities.png' %}[alt=Menu with Entities,width=300,role=pull-left]

TIP: To enable live-reloading of your code in iOS Simulator, first click on the emulator, then press kbd:[{commandkey} + R].

== Run Your React Native App on Android

To run your app on an Android emulator, run `react-native run-android`. If you don't have a phone plugged in or an Android Virtual Device (AVD) running, you'll see an error:

----
> com.android.builder.testing.api.DeviceException: No connected devices!
----

To fix this, open Android Studio, choose **open existing project**, and select the `android` directory in your project. If you're prompted to update the Android Gradle Plugin or "Install Build Tools and sync project," do it.

To create a new AVD, navigate to **Tools** > **AVD Manager**. Create a new Virtual Device and click Play. I chose a Pixel 2 as you can see from my settings below.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/avd-pixel-2.png' %}[alt=AVD Pixel 2,width=800,align=center]

You'll need to run a couple commands to allow the emulator to communicate with your API and Keycloak.

----
adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
adb reverse tcp:9080 tcp:9080
----

Run `react-native run-android` again. Now you should be able to log in just like you did on iOS.

TIP: To enable live-reloading of code on Android, first click on the emulator, then press kbd:[Ctrl + M] (kbd:[{commandkey} + M] on MacOS) or shake the Android device which has the running app. Then select the **Enable Live Reload** option from the popup.

For the rest of this tutorial, I'm going to show all the examples on iOS, but you should be able to use Android if you prefer.

== Generate CRUD Pages in React Native App

To generate pages for managing entities in your Spring Boot API, run the following command in the `react-native-app` directory.

[source,bash]
----
ignite generate import-jdl ../app.jh
----

Run `react-native run-ios`, log in, and click the **Entities** menu item. You should see a screen like the one below.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/ignite-entities.png' %}[alt=Ignite JHipster Entities Screen,width=400,align=center]

Click on the **Point** button, then click **Create** in the top right corner, and you should be able to add points.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/create-points.png' %}[alt=Create Points Screen,width=400,align=center]

== Tweak React Native Points Edit Screen to use Toggles

The goal of my 21-Points Health app is to count the total number of health points you get in a week, with the max being 21. For this reason, I think it's a good idea to change the integer inputs on exercise, meals, and alcohol to be toggles instead of raw integers. If the user toggles it on, the app should store the value as "1". If they toggle it off, it should record "0".

To make this change to the React Native app, open `app/modules/entities/points/points-entity-edit-screen.js` in your favorite editor. Change the `formModel` to use `t.Boolean` for exercise, meals, and alcohol.

[source,js]
----
formModel: t.struct({
  id: t.maybe(t.Number),
  date: t.Date,
  exercise: t.maybe(t.Boolean),
  meals: t.maybe(t.Boolean),
  alcohol: t.maybe(t.Boolean),
  notes: t.maybe(t.String),
  userId: this.getUsers()
}),
----

Then change the `entityToFormValue()` to set the toggle on if the value is 1.

[source,js]
----
entityToFormValue = (value) => {
  if (!value) {
    return {}
  }
  return {
    id: value.id || null,
    date: value.date || null,
    exercise: (value.exercise === 1),
    meals: (value.meals === 1),
    alcohol: (value.alcohol === 1),
    notes: value.notes || null,
    userId: (value.user && value.user.id) ? value.user.id : null
  }
}
----

And change `formValueToEntity()` to save 1 or 0, depending on the user's selection.

[source,js]
----
formValueToEntity = (value) => {
  const entity = {
    id: value.id || null,
    date: value.date || null,
    exercise: (value.exercise) ? 1 : 0,
    meals: (value.meals) ? 1 : 0,
    alcohol: (value.alcohol) ? 1 : 0,
    notes: value.notes || null
  }
  if (value.userId) {
    entity.user = { id: value.userId }
  }
  return entity
}
----

While you're at it, you can change the default `Points` entity to have today's date and `true` for every point by default. You can make this happen by modifying `componentWillMount()` and changing the `formValue`.

[source,js]
----
componentWillMount () {
  if (this.props.data.entityId) {
    this.props.getPoint(this.props.data.entityId)
  } else {
    this.setState({
      formValue: {
        id: null,
        date: new Date(),
        exercise: true,
        meals: true,
        alcohol: true
      }
    })
  }
  this.props.getAllUsers()
}
----

Refresh your app in Simulator using kbd:[{commandkey} + R]. When you create new points, you should see your new defaults.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/create-points-defaults.png' %}[alt=Create Points with defaults,width=400,align=center]

== Tweak React App's Points to use Checkboxes

Since your JHipster app has a React UI as well, it makes sense to change the points input/edit screen to use a similar mechanism: checkboxes. Open `jhipster-api/src/main/webapp/.../points-update.tsx` and replace the TSX (the T is for TypeScript) for the three fields with the following. You might notice the `trueValue` and `falseValue` attributes handle converting checked to true and vise versa.

[source,tsx]
.jhipster-api/src/main/webapp/app/entities/points/points-update.tsx
----
<AvGroup check>
  <AvInput id="points-exercise" type="checkbox" className="form-control"
    name="exercise" trueValue={1} falseValue={0} />
  <Label check id="exerciseLabel" for="exercise">
    <Translate contentKey="healthPointsApp.points.exercise">Exercise</Translate>
  </Label>
</AvGroup>
<AvGroup check>
  <AvInput id="points-meals" type="checkbox" className="form-control"
    name="meals" trueValue={1} falseValue={0} />
  <Label check id="mealsLabel" for="meals">
    <Translate contentKey="healthPointsApp.points.meals">Meals</Translate>
  </Label>
</AvGroup>
<AvGroup check>
  <AvInput id="points-alcohol" type="checkbox" className="form-control"
    name="alcohol" trueValue={1} falseValue={0} />
  <Label check id="alcoholLabel" for="alcohol">
    <Translate contentKey="healthPointsApp.points.alcohol">Alcohol</Translate>
  </Label>
</AvGroup>
----

In the `jhipster-api` directory, run `npm start` (or `yarn start`) and verify your changes exist. The screenshot below shows what it looks like when editing a record entered by the React Native app.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/react-checkboxes.png' %}[alt=checkboxes in React app,width=800,align=center]

==  Use Okta's API for Identity

Switching from Keycload to Okta for identity in a JHipster app is suuuper easy thanks to Spring Boot and Spring Security. First, you'll need an Okta developer account. If you don't have one already, you can signup at https://developer.okta.com/signup/[developer.okta.com/signup]. Okta is an OIDC provider like Keycloak, but it's always on, so you don't have to manage it.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/okta-signup.png' %}[alt=Okta Developer Signup,width=800,align=center]

Log in to your Okta Developer account and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Web** and click **Next**. Give the app a name you'll remember, specify `http://localhost:8080/login` as a Login redirect URI, `http://localhost:8080` as a Logout redirect URI, and click **Done**. Note the client ID and secret, you'll need to copy/paste them into a file in a minute.

Create a `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER` group (**Users** > **Groups** > **Add Group**) and add users to them. I recommend adding the account you signed up with to `ROLE_ADMIN` and creating a new user (**Users** > **Add Person**) to add to `ROLE_USER`.

Navigate to **API** > **Authorization Servers** and click the one named **default** to edit it. Click the **Claims** tab and **Add Claim**. Name it "groups", and include it in the ID Token. Set the value type to "Groups" and set the filter to be a Regex of `.*`. Click **Create** to complete the process.

Create a file on your hard drive called `~/.okta.env` and specify the settings for your app in it.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID="{yourClientId}"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET="{yourClientSecret}"
----

TIP: Make sure your `*URI` variables do not have `-admin` in them. This is a common mistake.

In the terminal where your Spring Boot app is running, kill the process, run `source ~/.okta.env` and run `./gradlew` again. You should be able to log in to `http://localhost:8080` with your browser.

=== Create a Native App with PKCE

Ignite JHipster leverages https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-native-app-auth[React Native AppAuth], an SDK for communicating with OAuth 2.0 providers. It supports PKCE instead of a client secret, which is a more secure configuration. To use PKCE, you'll need to create a new Native application in Okta.

Log in to your Okta Developer account and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Native** and click **Next**. Give the app a name you'll remember (e.g., `React Native`), select `Refresh Token` as a grant type, in addition to the default `Authorization Code`. Change the **Login redirect URI** to be `healthpoints://authorize`) and click **Done**.

Modify `react-native-app/app/modules/login/login.sagas.js` to use the generated clientId.

[source,js]
----
const { issuer, scope } = authInfo.data
const config = {
  issuer,
  clientId: '{yourNativeClientId}',
  scopes: scope.split(' '),
  redirectUrl: `${AppConfig.appUrlScheme}://authorize`
}
----

After making these changes, refresh or restart your React Native app and you should be able to log in.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/react-native-okta-login.png' %}[alt=Okta Login in React Native,width=400,align=center]

== Debugging React Native Apps

If you have issues, or just want to see what API calls are being made, you can use https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron[Reactotron]. Reactotron is a desktop app for inspecting your React and React Native applications. It should work with iOS without any changes. For Android, you'll need to run `adb reverse tcp:9090 tcp:9090` after your AVD is running.

Once it's running, you can see API calls being made, as well as log messages.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/react-native-spring-boot/reactotron.png' %}[alt=Reactotron,width=500,align=center]

If you'd like to log your own messages to Reactotron, you can use `console.tron.log('debug message')`.

== Packaging Your React Native App for Production

The last thing I'd like to show you to deploy your app to production. Since there are many steps to getting your React Native app onto a physical device, I'll defer to React Native's https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device[Running on Device documentation]. It should be as simple as plugging in your device via USB, configuring code signing in Xcode, and building/running your app. You'll also need to configure the API URL to point to your machine's IP address (in `react-native-app/app/config/app-config.js`). For example:

[source,js]
----
export default {
  apiUrl: 'http://192.168.50.30:8080/',
  appUrlScheme: 'healthpoints'
}
----

You know what's awesome about Spring Boot? There's a bunch of cloud providers that support it! If a platform supports Spring Boot, you should be able to run a JHipster app on it!

Follow the instructions below to deploy your API to Pivotal's Cloud Foundry and Google Cloud Platform using Kubernetes. Both Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes have multiple providers, so these instructions should work even if you're not using Pivotal or Google.

=== Deploy Your Spring Boot API to Cloud Foundry

JHipster has a https://www.jhipster.tech/cloudfoundry/[Cloud Foundry sub-generator] that makes it simple to deploy to Cloud Foundry. It only requires you run one command. However, you have Elasticsearch configured in your API and the sub-generator doesn't support automatically provisioning an Elasticsearch instance for you. To workaround this limitation, modify `jhipster-api/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml` and find the following configuration for Spring Data Jest:

[source,yaml]
----
data:
    jest:
        uri: http://localhost:9200
----

Replace it with the following, which will cause Elasticsearch to run in embedded mode.

[source,yaml]
----
data:
    elasticsearch:
        properties:
            path:
                home: /tmp/elasticsearch
----

To deploy everything on Cloud Foundry with http://run.pivotal.io/[Pivotal Web Services], you'll need to create an account, download/install the https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads[Cloud Foundry CLI], and sign-in (using `cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io`).

TIP: You may receive a warning after logging in `No space targeted, use 'cf target -s SPACE'`. If you do, log in to https://run.pivotal.io in your browser, create a space, then run the command as recommended.

Then run `jhipster cloudfoundry` in the `jhipster-api` directory. You can see the values I chose when prompted below.

----
CloudFoundry configuration is starting
? Name to deploy as? HealthPoints
? Which profile would you like to use? prod
? What is the name of your database service? elephantsql
? What is the name of your database plan? turtle
----

After you've successfully deployed your app, run the following commands so it uses Okta for OIDC.

[source,bash]
----
source ~/.okta.env
export CF_APP_NAME=healthpoints
cf set-env $CF_APP_NAME FORCE_HTTPS true
cf set-env $CF_APP_NAME SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI "$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI"
cf set-env $CF_APP_NAME SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI "$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI"
cf set-env $CF_APP_NAME SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI "$SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI"
cf set-env $CF_APP_NAME SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID "$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID"
cf set-env $CF_APP_NAME SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET "$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET"

After overriding the default OIDC settings for Spring Security, you'll need to add `https://healthpoints.cfapps.io/login` as a Login redirect URI in your Okta OIDC application. You'll also want to add `https://healthpoints.cfapps.io` to your Logout redirect URIs so logout works.

Then... you'll be able to authenticate. Voila! üòÉ

Modify your React Native application's `apiUrl` (in `app/config/app-config.js`) to be `https://healthpoints.cfapps.io/` and deploy it to your phone. Hint: use the "running on device" docs I mentioned earlier.

[source,js]
----
export default {
  apiUrl: 'https://healthpoints.cfapps.io/',
  appUrlScheme: 'healthpoints'
}

I used Xcode on my Mac (`open react-native-app/ios/HealthPoints.xcworkspace`) and deployed it to an iPhone X. Below are screenshots that show it worked!

=== Deploy Your Spring Boot API to Google Cloud Platform using Kubernetes

JHipster also supports deploying your app to the üî• hottest thing in production: Kubernetes!

To try it out, create a `k8s` directory alongside your `jhipster-api` directory. Then run `jhipster kubernetes` in it. When prompted, specify the following answers:

* Type of application: **Monolithic application**
* Root directory: **../**
* Which applications: **jhipster-api**
* Setup monitoring: **No**
* Kubernetes namespace: **default**
* Docker repository name: <your Docker Hub username>
* Docker command: `docker push`
* Kubernetes service type: **LoadBalancer**

A number of commands will be printed out that you need to run. Run the following in the `jhipster-api` directory.

[source,bash]
----
docker login
export USERNAME=<your username>
./gradlew bootWar -Pprod jibDockerBuild
docker image tag healthpoints $USERNAME/healthpoints
docker push $USERNAME/healthpoints
----

Google Cloud Platform (a.k.a., GCP) is a PaaS (Platform As A Service) that is built on Google's core infrastructure. It's naturally a good provider for Kubernetes in the cloud. Complete the steps below to deploy your JHipster API to Google Cloud.

1. Create a Google Cloud project at https://console.cloud.google.com/[console.cloud.google.com].
2. Navigate to <https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list> to initialize the Kubernetes Engine for your project. If your project is not auto-selected, select it (in the nav bar) to start GKE initialization in GCP.
3. Install https://cloud.google.com/sdk/[Google Cloud SDK], log in, and set the project using:

       gcloud auth login
       gcloud config set project <project-name>

4. Create a cluster:

       gcloud components install kubectl
       gcloud container clusters create <cluster-name> --machine-type n1-standard-2 --scopes cloud-platform --zone us-west1-a
+
To see a list of possible zones, run `gcloud compute zones list`.
+
5. Set the environment variables for your Spring Boot application to use Okta for Identity. You can do this by modifying `k8s/healthpoints/healthpoints-deployment.yml`, adding to the `env` list, and specifying your `SECURITY_OAUTH2_*` values for your Okta OIDC app. In other words, add the name/value pairs just after `JAVA_OPTS`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
containers:
- name: healthpoints-app
  image: mraible/healthpoints
  env:
  - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
    value: prod
  - name: SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL
    value: jdbc:postgresql://healthpoints-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local:5432/HealthPoints
  - name: SPRING_DATA_JEST_URI
    value: http://healthpoints-elasticsearch.default.svc.cluster.local:9200
  - name: JAVA_OPTS
    value: " -Xmx256m -Xms256m"
  - name: SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI
    value: "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token"
  - name: SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI
    value: "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize"
  - name: SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI
    value: "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo"
  - name: SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID
    value: "{yourClientId}"
  - name: SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET
    value: "{yourClientSecret}"
----
+
6. Run `./kubectl-apply.sh` from the `k8s` directory. You should see a bunch of _created_ messages.

       deployment.apps "healthpoints" created
       deployment.extensions "healthpoints-elasticsearch" created
       service "healthpoints-elasticsearch" created
       deployment.extensions "healthpoints-postgresql" created
       service "healthpoints-postgresql" created
       service "healthpoints" created
+
You can use `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl logs -f {podName}` to see the logs.
+
       $ kubectl get pods
       NAME                                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
       healthpoints-6b56d9d646-h9cn2                 1/1       Running   0          3m
       healthpoints-elasticsearch-84cf759984-vwhv8   1/1       Running   0          18m
       healthpoints-postgresql-56ddd4bfc9-mptch      1/1       Running   0          18m

7. Run `kubectl get svc healthpoints` to get the external IP of your application on Google Cloud. Open `http://<external-ip>:8080` to view your running application.

8. Update your Okta application to have the app's IP address as a Login redirect URI (e.g., `http://<external-ip>:8080/login`). Then, verify everything works.

9. Scale your app as needed with `kubectl`:

       kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment/healthpoints
+
Run `kubectl get pods` to watch your pods startup.
+
       NAME                                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
       healthpoints-6b56d9d646-5lmjk                 0/1       Running   0          14s
       healthpoints-6b56d9d646-h9cn2                 1/1       Running   0          7m
       healthpoints-6b56d9d646-vsm4r                 0/1       Running   0          14s
       healthpoints-elasticsearch-84cf759984-vwhv8   1/1       Running   0          23m
       healthpoints-postgresql-56ddd4bfc9-mptch      1/1       Running   0          23m

The result? A Spring Boot API running in production on GKE!! _Wahoo!_

=== React Native + Spring Boot on GCP

To make your React Native app work with your GCP instance, you just need to modify its `app-config.js` file to point to its URI, then package and deploy.

[source,js]
----
export default {
  apiUrl: 'http://<external-ip>:8080',
  appUrlScheme: 'healthpoints'
}
----

=== Secrets: Change the API URL for Different Environments

You might think it's a pain that you had to change the API URL for the different environments (local development vs. Cloud Foundry vs. Google Cloud). I agree!

Luckily, https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config[react-native-config] is already built-in to Ignite JHipster. This project allows you to expose config variables to your JavaScript code in React Native. You can store API keys, URLs, and other sensitive information in a `.env` file.

----
API_URL=https://production-is-awesome.cfapps.io
----

To use react-native-config in your application, use the following steps:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update `.gitignore` to ignore it.
2. Add your config variables.
3. Follow instructions at https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config#setup[luggit/react-native-config#setup].
4. Change your `AppConfig.js` to the following:

[source,js]
----
import Secrets from 'react-native-config'

export default {
  apiUrl: Secrets.API_URL,
  appUrlScheme: 'healthpoints'
}
----

== Explore React Native, Spring Boot, and JHipster

This tutorial showed you how to build a secure Spring Boot API (powered by JPA, PostgreSQL, and Elasticsearch) with just a few commands. Then you learned how to run your app with Gradle, use Docker to run external services, and verify you had high-quality code with Sonar. And that was just the beginning!

I showed you how to build a React Native app, again with just a few commands. Heck, even deploying to the cloud only took a handful of interesting CLI commands.

The source code for this tutorial is available on GitHub https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-native-spring-boot-example[@oktadeveloper/okta-react-native-spring-boot-example].
