React Native is a mobile app framework from Facebook. It allows you to develop apps using React's API and deploy it to iOS and Android with ease. It allows you to quickly refresh the apps when you make changes and generally offers a pleasant experience for web developers.

https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/[React Native for Web] is a recent addition to the React Native family. It allows you to run your app in a browser and enjoy the developer tools it offers. It's optimized for mobile and uses the same components as React Native, so it looks good too!

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to create a React Native application that deploys to web, iOS, and Android. You'll configure it to use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication and use OAuth 2.0 access tokens to talk securely to a Spring Boot API.

**Prerequisites:**

* https://adoptopenjdk.net/[Java 11+]
* https://nodejs.org[Node 16+]

If you're on Windows, you may need to install the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about[Windows Subsystem for Linux] for some commands to work.

I recommend using SDKMAN to manage your OpenJDK installations. Just run `sdk install java 11.0.2-open` to install Java 11 and `sdk install java 17-open` for Java 17.

== Quick Apps with JHipster

JHipster is a full-stack application generator that uses Spring Boot on the backend and Angular, React, or Vue on the frontend. It started as an open source project in 2013, before any of these frameworks existed. Back then, it used Spring MVC for the backend and AngularJS for the frontend.

Its popularity grew quickly along with its adoption and rise of the aforementioned frameworks. Today, it averages over 100K downloads per month. It even has a healthy budget thanks sponsors and backers via https://opencollective.com/generator-jhipster[Open Collective].

Why am I telling you this? Because JHipster is going to help you build your React Native app _and_ it was used to create the backend in a previous tutorial.

== JHipster blueprints for more power!

A **blueprints** feature was added to JHipster several years ago. It allows you, as a developer, to create a project that overrides the default behavior of JHipster. This has feature has lead to a https://www.jhipster.tech/modules/official-blueprints/[thriving ecosystem of blueprints], from Kotlin to Micronaut to .NET Core to NestJS to Svelte to Ionic and even React Native.

Today, I'll show you how to use https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-react-native[JHipster's React Native blueprint] to build a Flickr clone. The backend will be powered by the Spring Boot app created in https://auth0.com/blog/full-stack-java-with-react-spring-boot-and-jhipster/[Full Stack Java with React, Spring Boot, and JHipster] tutorial. The React Native app's screens will be generated from the same JDL (JHipster Domain Language) file that created the backend entities.

I'm excited to show you how to use JHipster React Native because its https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-react-native/releases/tag/v4.3.0[4.3.0 release] upgrades it Expo 46, React Native 0.69.5, and React 18. Let's giddyup! 🤠

== Build a Photo Gallery with React and Spring Boot

Start by creating a new directory to hold your frontend and backend projects:

[source,shell]
----
take react-native-spring-boot
----

NOTE: `take` is a command that makes a directory and moves into it.

Clone an existing JHipster app into a `backend` directory:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git backend
----

This app is configured to use OIDC for authentication and needs a provider configured to start correctly. To make things easy, there's a pre-configured Keycloak instanced configured with a Docker Compose file. You can start it:

[source,shell]
----
cd backend
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
----

// _If you'd rather skip this part, I'll show you how to configure and use Auth0 in a minute._

.Apple Silicon and Keycloak
****
If you're using Apple Silicon (aka M1 or M2), Keycloak will fail to start because its Docker image wasn't available for an M1 when the backend project was created. To fix, run the script below.

[source,shell]
----
VERSION=15.0.2 # Keycloak version specified in keycloak.yml
cd /tmp
git clone git@github.com:keycloak/keycloak-containers.git
cd keycloak-containers/server
git checkout $VERSION
docker build -t "jboss/keycloak:${VERSION}" .
docker build -t "quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:${VERSION}" .
----
****

Then, start the backend using `./mvnw` and open your favorite browser to `\http://localhost:8080`. You should be able login with `admin/admin` and upload photos. They'll be displayed in nice grid, and you can click on each photo to zoom in.

image::{% asset_path blog/full-stack-java/photo-gallery.jpg %}[alt=Gallery with Photos,width=800,align=center]

Now, let's create a React Native app that talks to the same API.

== Generate a React Native App

Install React Native JHipster and the Expo CLI:

[source,shell]
----
npm install -g generator-jhipster-react-native expo-cli
----

Create a directory for your React Native app:

[source,shell]
----
take mobile
----

Run the following command to use the React Native blueprint to create an app.

[source,shell]
----
jhipster --blueprints react-native # you can also use `rnhipster`
----

When prompted, use the following values:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Prompt |Answer

|What do you want to name your React Native application?
|`Flickr2`

|Enter the directory where your JHipster app is located:
|`../backend`

|Do you want to enable end-to-end tests with Detox?
|`No`
|===

Next, generate screens based on the entities in the backend project. Press **a** (for **all**) when prompted to overwrite files.

[source,shell]
----
rnhipster jdl ../backend/flickr2.jdl
----

In the backend project, change its `src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml` to allow `\http://localhost:19006` for CORS (cross-origin resource sharing):

[source,yaml]
----
cors:
  allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:19006,...'
----

https://expo.dev/signup[Sign up for an Expo account] and take note of your username.

Login to http://localhost:9080/auth/admin/[Keycloak] (with `admin/admin` as credentials). Navigate to **Clients** > **web_app** and add `\https://auth.expo.io/@<your-expo-username>/Flickr2` as a Valid Redirect URI. **Save** your changes.

image::{% asset_path blog/react-native-jhipster/keycloak-expo-redirect.png %}[alt=Add Expo redirect to Keycloak,width=666,align=center]

Hide the metadata (height, width, date taken, and date uploaded) for photos in the add photo screen (`mobile/app/modules/entities/photo/photo-edit-screen.js`) when uploading a new photo. This isn't necessary, but the backend calculates these values for you, so they won't be saved. Below are the changes you need to make.

[source,jsx]
----
const metadata = (
  <div>
  // move the form fields for height, width, taken, and uploaded here
  </div>
)
const metadataRows = isNewEntity ? '' : metadata;

// Replace the form fields you moved with the following
{metadataRows}

== Run your React Native app

If the backend app isn't running, open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory. Then, run `./mvnw` (or `mvnw` on Windows). Of course, if you have Maven installed, you can simply run `mvn`.

Open a new terminal window and navigate into the `mobile` directory. Run `npm start` and type **w** to open in a web browser. You should be able to log in and view any photos you added to the backend. You can even edit and replace them.

// question: should I retake the last image so they're all the same height?

|===

=== Test on iOS

To see your React Native app running on iOS, press **i** in the window you ran `npm start` from. You will need to be on a Mac with Xcode installed for this to work.

| image::{% asset_path blog/react-native-jhipster/react-native-ios-photo.jpg %}[alt=React Native photo on iOS,width=350,align=center]
|===

TIP: You can reload your app in Simulator using kbd:[{commandKey} + R].

=== Test on Android

To see your React Native app running on Android, press **a** in the window you ran `npm start` from. You will need to have Android Studio installed and an AVD (Android Virtual Device) running. I tested on a Pixel 5 with API 31 (Android 12.0).

For the Android emulator to communicate with your API and Keycloak, you'll need to add some port mappings. If `8080` and `9080` are printed to your terminal, the command worked.

[source,shell]
----
adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080 && adb reverse tcp:9080 tcp:9080
----

CAUTION: If you get a `command not found` error, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10303639/adb-command-not-found[this Stack Overflow Q & A] to solve it. I used `echo export "PATH=~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc` on my Mac.

To reload your app, hit kbd:[r] twice with focus on the Android emulator.

== Use Auth0 for Identity

JHipster ships with Keycloak by default, when you choose OAuth 2.0 / OIDC as the authentication type. However, you can easily change it to another identity provider, like Auth0!

First, you'll need to configure the backend to use Auth0 by registering a regular web application. Log in to your Auth0 account (or https://auth0.com/signup[sign up] if you don't have an account). You should have a unique domain like `dev-xxx.us.auth0.com`.

Select *Create Application* in the https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications[Applications section]. Use a name like `JHipster Baby!`, select `Regular Web Applications`, and click *Create*.

Switch to the *Settings* tab and configure your application settings:

- Allowed Callback URLs: `\http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc`
- Allowed Logout URLs: `\http://localhost:8080/`

Scroll to the bottom and click *Save Changes*.

In the https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles[roles] section, create new roles named `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER`.

Create a new user account in the https://manage.auth0.com/#/users[users] section. Click on the *Role* tab to assign the roles you just created to the new account.

_Make sure your new user's email is verified before attempting to log in!_

Next, head to **Actions** > **Flows** and select **Login**. Create a new action named `Add Roles` and use the default trigger and runtime. Change the `onExecutePostLogin` handler to be as follows:

[source,js]
----
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const namespace = 'https://www.jhipster.tech';
  if (event.authorization) {
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim('preferred_username', event.user.email);
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
    api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
  }
}
----

This code is adding the user's roles to a custom claim (prefixed with `\https://www.jhipster.tech/roles`). This claim is mapped to Spring Security authorities in `SecurityUtils.java`.

Select **Deploy** and drag the `Add Roles` action to your Login flow. Create a `backend/.auth0.env` file and populate it with your Auth0 settings.

[source,shell]
----
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI=https://<your-auth0-domain>/
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
export JHIPSTER_SECURITY_OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=https://<your-auth0-domain>/api/v2/
----

NOTE: Want to have all these steps automated for you? Watch https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli/issues/351[issue #351] in the Auth0 CLI project.

Stop your backend app with kbd:[Ctrl+C] and run the following commands to configure Spring Security use Auth0.

[source,shell]
----
source .auth0.env
./mvnw
----

=== Create a Native OIDC App for React Native

For the React Native app to use Auth0, you'll need to create a *Native* app and add the following Allowed Callback URLs:

----
http://localhost:19006/,https://auth.expo.io/@<your-expo-username>/Flickr2
----

Configure Allowed Logout URLs:

----
http://localhost:19006,https://auth.expo.io/@<your-expo-username>/Flickr2
----

And, set the Allowed Origins (CORS):

----
http://localhost:19006,http://localhost
----

The second value is the origin header that Android sends. Copy the client ID to `app/config/app-config.js` and update the `audience` in `app/modules/login/login.utils.ts`:

[source,js]
----
audience: 'https://<your-auth0-domain>/api/v2/',
----

Restart your React Native app and log in with Auth0!

[cols="a,a", frame=none, grid=none]

| image::{% asset_path blog/react-native-jhipster/auth0-login-success.png %}[alt=Auth0 login success,width=300,align=center]
|===

It works on Android too. 🥳

| image::{% asset_path blog/react-native-jhipster/android-signed-in.png %}[alt=Android Auth0 login,width=300,align=center]
|===

=== Use Okta for Identity

If you'd like to use Okta as your identity provider, see https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta[JHipster's documentation] for how to configure the backend app.

TIP: You can configure JHipster quickly with the https://cli.okta.com[Okta CLI]: `okta apps create jhipster`

You'll need to https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#create-a-native-app-for-mobile-on-okta[create a native app on Okta] for React Native too.

== Log out from your identity provider

You probably didn't notice, but if you log in to your app when it's running on iOS or Android, then log out, when you try to log in again, you aren't prompted for credentials. This is because the React Native blueprint configures the best developer experience. It's kind of a pain to enter your credentials each time on a mobile device. Also, Expo's auth proxy does not currently work with logging out from the identity provider. If you look at `app/config/app-config.js`, you'll see that only `web` disables the auth proxy.

[source,js]
----
useExpoAuthProxy: Platform.select({ web: false, default: true }),
----

If you want to completely sign out on native apps, change the value to `false`.

[source,js]
----
useExpoAuthProxy: false,
----

This will cause your app's redirect URIs to change. You'll need to update your identity provider to add the following to your login and logout URLs:

[source,shell]
----
exp://<your-ip-address>:19000 # e.g., exp://172.20.10.4:19000
----

TIP: You can open your Auth0 app quickly with the https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli[Auth0 CLI]: `auth0 apps open`

After making these changes, reload your app. On iOS, it'll show a permission dialog when you try to log out.

image::{% asset_path blog/react-native-jhipster/auth0-logout-prompt.jpg %}[alt=Logout prompt on iOS,width=350,align=center]

Unfortunately, this is part of iOS and not something that can be suppressed. On the upside, your users probably don't want to fully log out. You haven't logged out of Gmail recently, have you?

== Deploying to production

The React Native project is configured to work with Expo Application Services (EAS) Build. To use it, you'll need to install the EAS CLI:

[source,shell]
----
npm install -g eas-cli
----

Then, log in to your Expo account:

[source,shell]
----
eas login
----

And configure your project:

[source,shell]
----
eas build:configure
----

For more information, see https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/[Creating your first build docs]. To learn how to deploy to production and make your app available in app stores, explore https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/deployment-patterns/[EAS Deployment patterns].

== Learn more about React Native, Spring Boot, and JHipster

I hope you enjoyed this quick tour of how to securely integrate a Spring Boot backend with a React Native frontend. JHipster generated most of the code, leaving you more time to implement your custom business logic. It's nice that OIDC authentication is supported out-of-the-box. It works so smooth with Keycloak, Auth0, and Okta!

You can find the source code for this example on GitHub, in the https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-react-native-jhipster-example[@oktadev/auth0-react-native-jhipster-example] repository.
