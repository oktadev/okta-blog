In this post, we will walk through how to build a simple CRUD application using Spring Boot, MySQL, JPA/Hibernate and Okta OpenID Connect (OIDC) Single Sign-On (SSO). 

The **Java Persistence API (JPA)** provides a specification for persisting, reading, and managing data from your Java object to relational tables in the database. The default implementation of JPA via Spring Boot is **Hibernate**. Hibernate saves you a lot of time writing code to persist data to a database, allowing you to focus on the business logic. 

In this example, we will use MySQL for the database.

The application you will build will have two main parts. The first is the authentication piece. This will use Okta OIDC SSO to authenticate admin or ordinary users into the application. The second part will be the management of user events. These events are a record of any time a new token is issued for this application. The event will store the user's name, internal id from Okta, and store additional information per token issuance including the time of the original login and the time the token was last used within the application to view a page. If you are wondering what the difference is between these three dates/times, here is a cheat-sheet:

- **Login Date/Time** -  This is the time at which the user actually had to enter their credentials. There can be more than one token issued against the same original login. This could be the time the user logged into this application, the Okta console, or another application tied to the same developer account (since this is an SSO example).
- **Token Date/Time** - When the user starts a session with the application described in this post, a new token is issued by Okta. This token is valid for a certain amount of time and is reused across page refreshes until it expires
- **Last View Date/Time** - This is the last time the application was viewed. If you refresh the page, this time will update, while the *Token Date/Time* and *Login Date/Time* should remain the same.

**Table of Contents**{: .hide }
* Table of Contents
{:toc}

## Summary of CRUD actions
**C**RUD - Create
When any user visits the application with a new session, they will be issued a new token. When this token is issued, a `userEvent` will be generated and persisted in the MySQL database. 

C**R**UD - Read
Ordinary users will be able to see a list of all of the times they have received a new Okta token for this application. The application will also display the *Login Date/Time* and *Last View Date/Time* for that token (described earlier).

Admin users will be able to see the same info as the normal user, but for all users who have logged into the system. 

CR**U**D - Update
Each time any user visits the application, it will check if the token that they are using has already been saved as a `userEvent`. If so, it will update that entry with a new *Last View Date/Time*

CRU**D** - Delete
Admin users will have the option to delete any of the user events in the system. 
Pro Tip: In a production system, you wouldn't want to ever delete a log history, particularly a log regarding authentication or authorization actions.  If this were production code and you had a requirement to *delete* log entries in order to hide them from ordinary users, you would likely want to implement this by setting a `deleted` flag on that record and only displaying records that are not flagged as deleted.

**Prerequisites**:

* Java 11+ - You can install it from [adoptopenjdk.net](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
* MySQL - You must have installed a local instance of MySQL or have access to a remote instance of MySQL. For this exercise, I recommend that you have a fresh empty database prepared and have the username and password for that database handy. They will be required in the `application.properties` file later.  If you don't have MySQL setup locally already, follow the instructions from the [MySQL Website](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/).

## Configure your Okta OIDC Application, Authorization Server, Groups, and Users

Before you dive into the code, you will want to first get your Okta configuration in place. 

### Set Up Your Okta OIDC Application

{% include setup/cli.md type="web" loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta" logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080" %}

Take note of the values in the generated `.okta.env` file. You'll use those values shortly.

### Add an Okta Authorization Server
Next, you'll set up an Authorization Server with custom claims and access policies. This drives whether or not Okta will issue a token when one is requested. Run `okta login` and open the returned URL in your browser. Sign in and go to **Security** > **API** > **Authorization Servers**. Click **Add Authorization Server**. Fill in the values as follows:

|Field          |Value              		            |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
|**Name**       |Beyond Authentication Application      |
|**Audience**  	|api://beyondauthenticationapplication  |
|**Description**| Beyond Authentication Application     |

Click **Create**. Click the **Claims** tab. Click **Add Claim**. Fill in the fields with these values and click **Create** (leave those not mentioned as their defaults):

|Field                      		|Value              		            |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|**Name**                   		|appName             			        |
|**Include in token type**  	    |ID Token Always    			        |
|**Value**             		        | "Beyond Authentication Application"   |

Note that there are double quotes (") around "Beyond Authentication Application".

Next, click on **Add Claim** again. Fill in the fields with these values and click **Create** (leave those not mentioned as their defaults):

|Field                      |Value              |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
|**Name**                   |groups             |
|**Include in token type**  |ID Token Always    |
|**Value Type**             | Groups            |
|**Filter Dropdown**        | Matches regex     |
|**Filter Value**           | .*                |


Click the **Access Policies** tab. Click **Add** Policy. Fill in the fields with these values and click **Create Policy**.

|Field                  |Value              		                    |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|**Name**               |Beyond Authentication Application              |
|**Description**  	    |Beyond Authentication Application              |
|**Assign to**          | The following clients                         |
|**Assign to clients**  | Start typing: `Beyond` in the input area below *The following clients* and click Add to the right of `Beyond Authentication Application`.|

This binds the policy to your OIDC app.

Next click **Add Rule**. Enter: `Beyond Authentication Application` for the **Rule Name** field. Deselect all the grant types except for **Authorization Code**. Click **Create Rule**. This ensures that the request must use the Authorization Code flow in order for Okta to create tokens. This is the most secure flow of all the available OAuth flows. It ensures that all sensitive information (like tokens) are delivered via a response to a POST request. Check out the references at the end of this post for more on OAuth flows.

Click the **Settings** tab and copy the **Issuer URL**. You'll make use of this value shortly.

### Create an Okta Admin Group for Your Spring Boot Application

In order to complete this application, we need to set up an "Admin" group for our application. To do this, within the Okta Admin Console, click on **Directory** > **Groups** and then click on **Add Group**. Enter the following values:

|Field                  |Value              |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
|**Name**               |Admin              |
|**Description**  	    |Admin Group        |

### Create Okta Users for Your Application

Finally, we need to create two users. The first will be an ordinary user and the second will be an admin user. Click on **Directory** > **People** and then click on **Add Person**. Fill out the form with the information for the ordinary (non-admin) user using the table below.  Repeat this for the Admin user, also using the table below.

|                           | Ordinary User           | Admin User              | Comments                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **First Name**                | Plain                   | Super                   | Can be anything you like                                                                                                           |
| **Last Name**                 | Jane                    | Admin                   | Can be anything you like                                                                                                           |
| **Username**                  | plainJane@something.com | superAdmin@something.com | Might prefer to test with an email you can actually access                                                                         |
| **Primary Email**             | plainJane@something.com | superAdmin@something.com |                                                                                                                                    |
| **Secondary Email**           |                         |                         |                                                                                                                                    |
| **Groups**                    |                         | Admin                   |                                                                                                                                    |
| **Password**                  | Set by Admin            | Set by Admin            | This is to simplify the demo. In a production environment, you will likely want this set to "set by user"                          |
| **Password Value**            | Test1234                | Test1234                | Complexity requirements: - at least 8 characters - a lowercase letter - an uppercase letter - a number - no parts of your username |
| **User must change password** | unchecked               | unchecked               | This is to simplify the demo. In a production environment, you will likely want this checked if you have admin set password.       |

Take note of the **username** and **password** for each of the two users you created as you will use them to login later on.

## Let's code it!

The structure of our project will look like this:

{% img blog/spring-boot-jpa/project_structure.png alt:"project" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

> **NOTE:** For this post, I will be using Eclipse, as it is my preferred IDE. However, you can use any IDE or editor you please.

### Dependencies

The [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) makes it super easy to create the scaffolding for your project. What's even better is that it has a RESTful API, so you can get everything setup right from the command line. Run this command:

```
curl -s https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
    -d dependencies=data-jpa,web,okta,thymeleaf,mysql \
    -d  packageName=com.okta.examples.jpa \
    -d groupId=com.okta.examples.jpa \
    -d name=BeyondAuthentication \
    > BeyondAuthentication.zip
```

Create a folder named: `BeyondAuthentication`, switch into it and unzip the resulting file. You'll see the whole project has been setup for you. Let's take a look at the `pom.xml` file, which has all the dependencies for the project.

The file should be set up as follows

```xml

            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>     
```
The dependencies above tell the system that you want to use Thymeleaf for your web templates, MySQL for your database, and Hibernate (the default JPA implementation) to persist and retrieve data from MySQL.

### Templates
Let's also knock out the HTML template now, so you will have an idea what the application is trying to do/show later. Create the `home.html` file in the `src/main/resources/templates` folder.

```xml
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO" crossorigin="anonymous">
    </head>

    <body>
        <div class="container-fluid">

                                        <tbody>
                                        <tr th:each="userEvent : ${userEvents}">
                                            <td th:text="${userEvent.name}"></td>

                                            <td th:text="${userEvent.lastViewedAtString}"></td>
                                            <td th:if="${isAdmin}"><a th:href="@{/delete/{id}(id=${userEvent.id})}" class="btn btn-primary"><i class="fas fa-user-times ml-2"></i></a></td>
                                        </tr>
                                        </tbody>
                                    </table>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

This template is very basic. It shows a list of user events and related fields. If the logged in user is an admin, it will show a delete button by each event. This template doesn't control which events are shown, that will be determined in the controller later.

### Project Configuration
We will configure the project via the `application.properties` file located in `src/main/resources`. In this file, we will configure the database connection, the Okta account information, and a few other fields.

```properties
okta.oauth2.issuer={authServerUrl}
okta.oauth2.clientId={clientId}
okta.oauth2.clientSecret={clientSecret}

## MySQL
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/{dbName}

spring.datasource.username={dbUser}
spring.datasource.password={dbPassword}

# drop in to create the table, good for testing, comment this in production. This will create the table for you on each load of application, so you may want to comment this out after the first load
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
```

The first section of the properties file is the Okta configuration.

The next section is the MySQL configuration. Replace the values inside the `{}` with the appropriate database name, user, and password. Note, you will have to replace the whole data source URL if you are not running MySQL locally.

The following line in the properties file is very important: `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create`

This property tells the system to create (or re-create) the table from scratch to match the definition in the POJO Entity class (described below). The first time you run your application, or any time you change the structure of the entity class, you will want to have this line uncommented. However, after the table is constructed as you like, you will want to comment this line out or else it will drop and recreate every time you run it and you may wonder why your data isn't persisting!

### POJO Entity
Under the `com.okta.examples.jpa` package, create the `UserEvent` class. This class is a POJO that represents the fields in the `UserEvent` object that will persist to the database.

```java
@Entity
public class UserEvent {

    private static SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm'Z'");

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    
    @Lob 
    private String token;

    private String userId;

    @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
    private Date loginAt;

    @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
    private Date tokenIssuedAt;

    @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
    private Date lastViewedAt;
    
    public UserEvent() {}

    public UserEvent(String userId, String name,String token,Date loginAt,Date issueAt) {
        this.userId=userId;
        this.name = name;
        this.token = token;
        this.loginAt = loginAt;
        this.lastViewedAt=loginAt;
        this.tokenIssuedAt=issueAt;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "UserEvent{" +
            "id=" + id +
            ", name='" + name + '\'' +
            ", token='" + token + '\'' +
            ", loginAt='" + loginAt + '\'' +
            '}';
    }

    // put boilerplate getters and setters here

    @Transient
    public String getTokenIssuedAtString() {
        return formatter.format(tokenIssuedAt);
    }
    
    @Transient
    public String getLastViewedAtString() {
        return formatter.format(lastViewedAt);
    }
    
    @Transient
    public String getLoginAtString() {
        return formatter.format(loginAt);
    }
}
```

The `@Entity` notation tells the system that this object will represent a row in a table. It tells Hibernate that this data should be stored in a table called `user_event` (from lowercasing the class name and adding "_" between words that were capitalized). If you want the table named something different, you can use the `@table(name="tbl_something")` annotation. The `@Entity` class also tells Hibernate that all of the non-static fields and/or getter methods should be persisted to the database. It will ignore any fields/methods that have the `@Transient` annotation and it will ignore methods that are a getter for a corresponding field. In this case, the entity will store the following fields in the database: `id`, `name`, `token`, `userId`, `loginAt`, `tokenIssuedAt`, and `lastViewedAt`. 

In most cases, Hibernate will understand the type of field that the values should be stored as in the database, but there are some times when you need to explicitly tell it what field type to use. In this example, I have used the annotation `Lob` to tell the system that the `token` field should be set to `longtext`. I have also used the `@Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)` annotation to specify that three of the fields should be saved as `datetime` values. Lastly, I have used the following annotations to indicate that the id field is the primary key that should be autogenerated by the database:

```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
```

### Repository

Create the `UserEventRepository` class. This class is a POJO that represents the fields in the `UserEventRepository` object that will expose the ability to read and write from the `user_event` table.

```java
public interface UserEventRepository extends JpaRepository<UserEvent, Long> {

    List<UserEvent> findByName(String name);
    List<UserEvent> findByToken(String token);
    List<UserEvent> findByUserId(String userId);
}
```

This class must extend `JpaRepository` with the type `UserEvent` specified so that it knows the type of objects that will be passed in and out. The `JpaRepository` interface already specifies basic read/write methods, like `findById()`, `findAll()`, and `save()`. However, if you want other find methods specific to the fields, you would include them here, as I did for `findByName()`, `findByToken()`, and `findByUserId()`. The magic is that you do not need to create the implementation class for the `UserEventRepository` as Spring will automatically create the implementation class at runtime. 

### Main Application Class

Take a look at the `BeyondAuthenticationApplication` that was automatically created by the Spring Initializr project. This class is the main application class that runs the application.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class BeyondAuthenticationApplication{

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(BeyondAuthenticationApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### Create a Controller Class to Route Requests

Last, but far from least, is the controller class. Create the `HomeController` class. This class does all of the work to read and write from the database. It also prepares the objects needed for the template to render including the list of events to show (all or just the user's) and whether the logged in user is an admin or not.

```java
@RestController
public class HomeController {

    private final UserEventRepository userEventRepository;

    public HomeController(UserEventRepository userEventRepository) {
        this.userEventRepository = userEventRepository;
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/")
    public ModelAndView home(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user) {
        String token = user.getIdToken().getTokenValue();
        
        //check if first time with this token, if so record new auth event
        List<UserEvent> userEventsForToken = userEventRepository.findByToken(token);
        UserEvent event;
        if (userEventsForToken.size() == 0) {
            //add new event
            event = new UserEvent(
                user.getSubject(), user.getClaims().get("name").toString(),
                token, Date.from(user.getAuthenticatedAt()), Date.from(user.getIssuedAt())
            );
        } else {
            //edit existing event
            event = userEventsForToken.get(0); //there will only ever be one because we update it if it exists already
            event.setLastViewedAt(Date.from(Instant.now()));
        }
        userEventRepository.save(event);
        
        List<UserEvent> eventsToShow;
        boolean isAdmin = user.getUserInfo().getClaimAsStringList("groups").contains("Admin");
        if (isAdmin) {
            eventsToShow = userEventRepository.findAll();
        } else {
            eventsToShow = userEventRepository.findByUserId(user.getSubject());
        }
        
        ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView();
        mav.addObject("user", user.getUserInfo());
        mav.addObject("idToken", user.getIdToken().getTokenValue());
        mav.addObject("userEvents",eventsToShow);
        mav.addObject("isAdmin",isAdmin);
        mav.setViewName("home");
        return mav;
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/delete/{id}")
    public RedirectView deleteUser(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user,@PathVariable("id") long id, Model model) {
        UserEvent userEvent = userEventRepository.findById(id)
          .orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid event Id:" + id));
        userEventRepository.delete(userEvent);
        return new RedirectView("/");
    }
}
```

The constructor of this class automatically passes in the `UserEventRepository` implementation that Spring auto generated for you. This is the modern way to handle dependency injection. We don't need the `@Autowired` annotation anymore.

The `home` method is annotated with the `@GetMapping("/")` annotation which tells the system to serve this model/view anytime someone accesses the application with no other path information specified. This method builds up the model and view for the main page of the site that uses the `home.xml` template. It does the following:

- Uses the token to look up old user events to see if one already exists for this token. If so, it updates the `lastViewedAt` time. If not, it creates a new user event. 
- Determines if the logged in user is admin or not
- Gets list of user events. If user is admin, it gets all of the events. If the user is not an admin, it only gets events for that user.
- It returns the model and view with the appropriate variables set to use for rendering the template

The `deleteUser` method is annotated with the `@GetMapping("/delete/{id}")` annotation which tells it to execute this method when a user calls a URL or clicks on a link with the href that passes in the id of the event to delete. The `home.html` template included links with this URL configured for an admin to delete user events. This is the code that will get triggered when the user clicks on the delete button. The code simply finds the user event, deletes it, and then redirects back to the main listing page, where you will see the updated list without the deleted item.

## Let's Run it!

Let's see it in action!  In Eclipse, just right click on the `BeyondAuthenticationApplication` file, click **Run as** > **Java application**, and it will kick it off. You can now test your application!  Type `http://localhost:8080` into your favorite web browser. You should be presented with an Okta login screen:

{% img blog/spring-boot-jpa/okta_login.png alt:"okta login" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

> **NOTE:** If you don't see the Okta login screen, it is likely because you recently logged into the dev console and it is recognizing that login as valid for this application (after all, it is SSO). If that is the case, just use a different browser or an incognito browser tab.

From the login screen, login as your admin user. It will then redirect you back to your application, which should look something like this:

{% img blog/spring-boot-jpa/app_admin.png alt:"admin" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Next, let's login with a non-admin user. Do the same steps as above in a different browser or within a new incognito tab. It should present you with the login screen again. From there, log in with your non-admin user and you will see something like this:

{% img blog/spring-boot-jpa/app_user.png alt:"user" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Notice, the delete button is missing. When you refresh your screen for the admin user, you will now see events for both your admin and your non-admin. However, the view for your non-admin user will only ever show their own events.

Play around with the delete button from the admin's view and try refreshing the page and notice that the last view date/time of the entry will update. If you log in again later on, you will see multiple entries for the user once a new token is issued.
