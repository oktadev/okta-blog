It seems that OAuth 2.0 is everywhere these days. Whether you are building a hot new single page web application (SPA), a native mobile experience, or just trying to integrate with the API economy, you can't go far without running into the popular authorization framework for REST/APIs and social authentication.

During [Oktane15](https://www.okta.com/oktane15/), [Karl McGuinness](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlmcguinness), our Senior Director of Identity, demystified the powerful, yet often misunderstood, world of OAuth 2.0 and shared details on Okta's growing support for [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/).
