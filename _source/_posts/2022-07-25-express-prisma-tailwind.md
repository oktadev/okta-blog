[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is an ORM (object–relational mapping) tool for Node.js using TypeScript.  The software integrates with many of the most popular databases today, including MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, and MongoDB, and emphasizes a human-readable schema with a type-safe database client.  Prisma also includes other features such as migrations, seed data, and a virtual database browser.   

In this project, you will use Prisma to connect your [Express](https://expressjs.com/) application to a database server.  You will build a schema to model a workout tracker application.  Then you'll create some seed data and use Prisma to run migrations and seed your database.  Finally, you'll create the web application using [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to build the application frontend.

**Prerequisites**

This tutorial uses the following technologies but doesn't require any prior experience:

- An IDE for JavaScript.  I will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but you can use Webstorm, or any other IDE you prefer.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A database, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, or MongoDB.  In this tutorial we'll use SQLite.
- [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)

If you'd like to skip the tutorial and check out the fully built project, you can go [view it on GitHub](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-express-prisma-tailwind-example).

## Create your OAuth2 authorization server

Create a new directory for your application.  Use the `cd` command to navigate to that folder. 

{% include setup/cli.md type="web" loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback" logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000/" %}

## Create your Express application

Next, you will use the `express-generator` application generator tool to quickly scaffold your application.  Run the following command.

```console
npx express-generator@4.16 --view=pug
```

Now you can install your packages.  

```console
npm i @prisma/client@3.13.0
npm i dotenv@16.0.0
npm i passport@0.5.2
npm i passport-openidconnect@0.1.1
npm i express-session@1.17
npm i -D tailwindcss@3.0.24
npm i -D prisma@3.13.0
```

- `@prisma/client` is used to access the database from your server code.
- `dotenv` reads configuration settings from `.env` files like the one produced by the Okta CLI.
- `passport` is a middleware for Node.js that is flexible enough to handle most authentication scenarios, including Okta.  `passport-openidconnect` is a module for passport that lets you authenticate with OpenID Connect.
- `express-session` is required for passport.  Express apps use this package for session support.  Your application must intiialize session support to use passport.  
- `Tailwind CSS` is the CSS framework you will use.  If you've never used Tailwind before, you may wonder why it's a development dependency.  This is because Tailwind will dynamically build your CSS files from your views and configuration.  More on that later.
- `prisma` is the ORM you are using.  This is a dev dependency because the Prisma library handles the migrations, seed data, etc., while the `@prisma/client` package is used in your application at runtime.

At this point, you will initialize Tailwind CSS and Prisma. You will configure them for usage later on.

Start with Prisma and run the following command.

```console
npx prisma init
```

This command will add a new folder named `prisma` to your application. It also adds a file called `.env` to your project with some default configuration. Replace the contents of that file with the code below.

```bash
# Environment variables declared in this file are automatically made available to Prisma.
# See the documentation for more detail: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema#accessing-environment-variables-from-the-schema

# Prisma supports the native connection string format for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB, and CockroachDB (Preview).
# See the documentation for all the connection string options: https://pris.ly/d/connection-strings

DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
SEED_USER_NAME={yourOktaUserName}
```

In this example, I used SQLite because it's easy and compact.  But one of the cool things about Prisma and most ORMs is that they can support many databases.  The boilerplate code includes comments about configuring your application for other database servers.  Feel free to use what you feel most comfortable with and use the appropriate connection string.

Your seed data will use the `SEED_USER_NAME` setting.  You want to ensure that it's the same as the Okta username with which you sign in.  This will allow the application to associate your logged-in user with the data you will seed into your database.  

Next, update your `package.json` file with the following code.

```JSON
{
  "name": "workout-app",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "prisma": {
    "seed": "node prisma/seed.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@prisma/client": "^3.13.0",
    "cookie-parser": "~1.4.4",
    "debug": "~2.6.9",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.0",
    "express": "~4.16.1",
    "http-errors": "~1.6.3",
    "morgan": "~1.9.1",
    "passport": "^0.5.2",
    "passport-openidconnect": "^0.1.1",
    "pug": "2.0.0-beta11"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "prisma": "^3.13.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.0.24"
  }
}
```

This will add the `prisma seed` command you need later.  

Now you can initialize Tailwind CSS.  

```console
npx tailwindcss init
```

You've now added a new file called `tailwind.config.js` to the root of your application.  Replace the contents of that file with the code below.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ["./views/**/*.pug"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

In this step, you tell Tailwind CSS where to find the classes you used in your application.  You want Tailwind to look in the `.pug` files in your `views` directory.  Tailwind CSS is highly extensible, as seen by the configuration object's `theme` and `plugins` settings.  A deep dive into this is out of the scope of this article, but I encourage you to look into Tailwind CSS's site for more information.  

## Use Prisma to create your database

The next task is to create the database for your application.  Steps will involve writing the schema, writing some seed data, creating the migration, and applying the migration, which will also seed your data.

The `prisma init` task from above should have added a file called `schema.prisma` to your `prisma` directory.  Replace the code there with the code below.

```javascript
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "{yourDatabaseProvider}"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model WorkoutLog {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId    Int
  exercise  String
  amount    Decimal
  units     String
  date      DateTime
  minutes   Int
  calories  Int
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

model User {
  id          Int          @id @default(autoincrement())
  username    String       @unique
  workoutLogs WorkoutLog[]
}
```

Make sure you replace `{yourDatabaseProvider}` with [the provider you are using](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource).  As you can see, this file defines the `User` and `WorkoutLog` objects that you will store in the database.  The `WorkoutLog` has basic information about the user's workout on a specific day and then associates that record with the `User` object.  You can also define keys, constraints, and indices from this file.  Note the `user` property on the `WorkoutLog` has a relation defined by the `userId` to the `id` of the `User` table.  

Add a file to the `prisma` directory named `seed.js` and add the following code to it.

```javascript
const { PrismaClient } = require("@prisma/client");
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

require("dotenv").config();

async function main() {
  const user = await prisma.user.upsert({
    where: { username: process.env.SEED_USER_NAME },
    update: {},
    create: {
      username: process.env.SEED_USER_NAME,
      workoutLogs: {
        create: [
          {
            exercise: "Running",
            amount: 1,
            units: "Miles",
            date: new Date(2022, 1, 1),
            minutes: 8,
            calories: 100
          },
          {
            exercise: "Running",
            amount: 1.2,
            units: "Miles",
            date: new Date(2022, 1, 3),
            minutes: 10,
            calories: 120
          },
          {
            exercise: "Running",
            amount: 1.5,
            units: "Miles",
            date: new Date(2022, 1, 5),
            minutes: 12,
            calories: 150
          },
          {
            exercise: "Heavy Bag",
            amount: 4,
            units: "Rounds",
            date: new Date(2022, 1, 1),
            minutes: 15,
            calories: 100
          },
          {
            exercise: "Heavy Bag",
            amount: 6,
            units: "Rounds",
            date: new Date(2022, 1, 3),
            minutes: 22,
            calories: 150
          },
          {
            exercise: "Heavy Bag",
            amount: 4,
            units: "Rounds",
            date: new Date(2022, 1, 5),
            minutes: 15,
            calories: 100
          },
          {
            exercise: "Situps",
            amount: 50,
            units: "Reps",
            date: new Date(2022, 1, 2),
            minutes: 5,

          },
          {
            exercise: "Pushups",
            amount: 100,
            units: "Reps",
            date: new Date(2022, 1, 2),
            minutes: 10,
            calories: 100
          },
          {
            exercise: "Situps",
            amount: 50,
            units: "Reps",
            date: new Date(2022, 1, 4),
            minutes: 5,
            calories: 50
          },
          {
            exercise: "Pushups",
            amount: 100,
            units: "Reps",
            date: new Date(2022, 1, 4),
            minutes: 10,
            calories: 100
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  });
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    console.error(e);
    process.exit(1);
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
```

Prisma knows to use the `seed.js` file from the command you added to `package.json`.  This file will insert the data when you run that command.  

You can now add and apply the migration using the Prisma CLI. From the root of your application directory, run the following command.

```console
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

The CLI has several ways to add and apply migrations.  I suggest you understand the best way to manage migrations for your environment.  The method above is the easiest and fastest way to prepare your database.  As part of the migration process, this command will look for the `seed` command from your `package.json` and run that as well.  Once complete, your database should be ready with a database full of seed data to work with.

## Add OIDC authentication

Now that your database is ready, you can turn your attention to the core of your application.

First, add a new file in the root of your application called `ensureLoggedIn.js` and add the following code to it.

```javascript
function ensureLoggedIn(req, res, next) {
    if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        return next();
    }
    res.redirect('/login')
}

module.exports = ensureLoggedIn;
```

This little piece of middleware will make sure the user is authenticated.  If they aren't, you will redirect them to the `login` route, which you will configure to use Okta.  Otherwise, you will allow the user to reach the next screen.  

Next, you can update your routes in the `routes` directory.  First, remove `users.js` as you won't be using that.  Replace the code in `index.js` with the following.

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'The Workout Tracker - Home', isAuthenticated: req.isAuthenticated() });
});

module.exports = router;
```

Here you will pass a property for `isAuthenticated` so your layout page can properly display a login or logout button.  

Next, add a file in the `routes` directory for `dashboard.js` with the following code.

```javascript
var express = require("express");
var router = express.Router();

const { PrismaClient } = require("@prisma/client");
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const ensureLoggedIn = require("../ensureLoggedIn");

/* GET home page. */
router.get("/", ensureLoggedIn, async function (req, res) {
  const username = req.user.username;

  const dbUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: {
      username: username,
    },
    include: {
      workoutLogs: true,
    },
  });

  res.render("dashboard", {
    title: "The Workout Tracker - Dashboard",
    isAuthenticated: req.isAuthenticated(),
    user: dbUser
  });
});

module.exports = router;
```

There's a lot of magic in this route.  First, you are using the `ensureLoggedIn` middleware to protect the route.  Then you can extract the username from the request and look up the user in the database using the Prisma client.  Since the user has a property for its workout logs, you can pass the user as the model and parse the logs on the pug view you will create.  This will give view access to the user's name as well.  Of course, you could query the `workoutLogs` table directly and include features such as pagination and search if this approach better fits your workflow.  

Now, replace the code in `app.js` with the following.

```javascript
var createError = require('http-errors');
var express = require('express');
var path = require('path');
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var logger = require('morgan');

var indexRouter = require('./routes/index');
var dashboardRouter = require('./routes/dashboard');

const session = require('express-session');
const passport = require('passport');
const { Strategy } = require('passport-openidconnect');

var app = express();

const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

require('dotenv').config({path:'./.okta.env'});

// view engine setup
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'pug');

app.use(session({
  secret: 'CanYouLookTheOtherWay',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true
}));

app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());


const {OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID, OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET, OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER} = process.env;

// set up passport
passport.use('oidc', new Strategy({
  issuer: OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER,
  authorizationURL: `${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}/v1/authorize`,
  tokenURL: `${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}/v1/token`,
  userInfoURL: `${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}/v1/userinfo`,
  clientID: OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET,
  callbackURL: 'http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback',
  scope: 'openid profile'
}, (issuer, profile, done) => {
  return done(null, profile);
}));

passport.serializeUser((user, next) => {
  next(null, user);
});

passport.deserializeUser((obj, next) => {
  next(null, obj);
});

app.use(logger('dev'));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.use('/login', passport.authenticate('oidc'));

app.use('/authorization-code/callback',
  passport.authenticate('oidc', { failureRedirect: '/error' }),
  (req, res, next) => {
    res.redirect('/dashboard');
  }
);

app.post('/logout', (req, res) => {
  req.logout();
  req.session.destroy();
  res.redirect('/');
});

app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/dashboard', dashboardRouter);

// catch 404 and forward to error handler
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  next(createError(404));
});

// error handler
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  // set locals, only providing error in development
  res.locals.message = err.message;
  res.locals.error = req.app.get('env') === 'development' ? err : {};

  // render the error page
  res.status(err.status || 500);
  res.render('error');
});

module.exports = app;
```

You updated your routes to properly use the `dashboard` routes as well as any login or logout routes that Okta will use.  You also set up passport to use Okta using the values the Okta CLI produced in the `.okta.env` file.  

## Add views to your Express application

By default, `express-generator` will add a few views for you.  You will need to edit them and add a new one of your own.  Start by opening the `layout.pug` file in the `views` directory and replacing the code there with the following.

```pug
doctype html
html
  head
    title= title
    link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/output.css')
  body
    nav.flex.items-center.justify-between.flex-wrap.bg-teal-500.p-6.flex.items-center.flex-shrink-0.text-white.mr-6
      span.font-semibold.text-xl.tracking-tight.pr-2 The Workout Tracker
      .w-full.block.flex-grow(class='lg:flex lg:items-center lg:w-auto')
        .text-sm(class='lg:flex-grow')
        div
          if(isAuthenticated)
            form(action="logout" method="POST") 
              button(type="submit").inline-block.text-sm.px-4.py-2.leading-none.border.rounded.text-white.border-white.mt-4 Logout
          else 
            a.inline-block.text-sm.px-4.py-2.leading-none.border.rounded.text-white.border-white.mt-4(href='Login' class='hover:border-transparent hover:text-teal-500 hover:bg-white lg:mt-0') Login
    
    block content
```

You'll notice a couple of things about this file.  First, the classes are very specific and plentiful.  This is typical of Tailwind CSS.  Rather than defining how a specific element looks, Tailwind CSS strives to define how a particular style looks, then you can add and remove styles from elements to fit the desired look.  

The other thing you'll see is the **Login/Logout** button that will change based on the `isAuthenticated` property.  

Next, your can update `index.pug` with the following.

```pug
extends layout

block content
  .py-12.bg-white
    .max-w-7xl.mx-auto.px-4(class='sm:px-6 lg:px-8')
      div.c(class='lg:text-center')
        p.mt-2.text-3xl.leading-8.font-extrabold.tracking-tight.text-gray-900(class='sm:text-4xl') The Workout Tracker
        p.mt-4.max-w-2xl.text-xl.text-gray-500(class='lg:mx-auto')
          | A small demo built with 
          a(href="https://expressjs.com/") Express on 
          a(href="https://nodejs.org/en/") Node.JS 
          | Secured with 
          a(href="https://developer.okta.com/signup") Okta.
          br          
          | This app uses 
          a(href="https://tailwindcss.com/") Tailwind CSS 
          | for its CSS framework and 
          a(href="https://www.prisma.io/") Prisma.JS 
          | for its ORM.  
```

There's not much to talk about here.  Just a splash page with some more Tailwind CSS and some links to the technologies used.

Finally, add a file for `dashboard.pug` with the following code.

```pug
extends layout

block content 
    .flex.flex-wrap
        .w-full.p-6(class='md:w-1/2 xl:w-1/3')
            .bg-gradient-to-b.from-green-200.to-green-100.border-b-4.border-green-600.rounded-lg.shadow-xl.p-5
                .flex.flex-row.items-center
                    .flex-shrink.pr-4
                        .rounded-full.p-5.bg-green-600
                            i.fa.fa-wallet.fa-2x.fa-inverse
                    .flex-1.text-right(class='md:text-center')

                            span= user.workoutLogs.reduce(function(total, item) { return total + item.minutes }, 0) 
                            span.text-green-500
                                i.fas.fa-caret-up
        .w-full.p-6(class='md:w-1/2 xl:w-1/3')
            .bg-gradient-to-b.from-pink-200.to-pink-100.border-b-4.border-pink-500.rounded-lg.shadow-xl.p-5
                .flex.flex-row.items-center
                    .flex-shrink.pr-4
                        .rounded-full.p-5.bg-pink-600
                            i.fas.fa-users.fa-2x.fa-inverse
                    .flex-1.text-right(class='md:text-center')
                        h2.font-bold.uppercase.text-gray-600 Total Calories Burned
                        p.font-bold.text-3xl
                            span= user.workoutLogs.reduce(function(total, item) { return total + item.calories }, 0)

As you saw before, this page is protected.  Therefore, it requires that you have a user to access this page.  The application will pull the user details and workout logs and form them into a summary at the top of the page with a couple of tables of the logs based on the exercises the user has performed.  

## Create the CSS file using Tailwind CSS

The last part of this process is to create the actual CSS file that your application will use.  In your `public/stylesheets` directory, you'll see a file called `style.css`.  Replace the code in that file with the code below.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

body {
  padding: 50px;
  font: 14px "Lucida Grande", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}

a {
  color: #00B7FF;
}
```

This is largely the same. However, you are importing the directives for each of Tailwind's layers.

Next, you can compile the classes you used in your pug files and the style sheet you just modified to create a new CSS file. Run the following command.

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./public/stylesheets/style.css -o ./public/stylesheets/output.css --watch
```

Now you can open the `output.css` file and see the complete Tailwind CSS code.  The `--watch` parameter here is helpful for local development.  This will rebuild the `output.css` file each time you change one of your layouts.  You can disregard that parameter if you do not want to make any changes.

## Test your application

You're now ready to start your application.  Run the following command.

```bash
npm run start
```

Once your application is started you should be able to navigate to *http://localhost:3000/* and see your home page.

Use the login button at the top of the screen and navigate out to the Okta login page.  Once you've logged in you will be redirected back to your website where you will be able to see your dashboard page.

## What you learned in this article

In this article, you learned how to use Prisma to define a schema for your database.  You then learned how to create a migration from that schema and seed your database.  You saw that Prisma could be used with the most popular database options, including SQL Server, MySql, MongoDB, and more.  

You also learned how to build a CSS file with Tailwind CSS.  We walked through a simple tailwind configuration and how the Tailwind CLI uses your code to build its CSS file.

Finally, you learned how to secure your express application using passport.
