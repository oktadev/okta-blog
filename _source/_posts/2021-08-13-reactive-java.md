Modern applications must work smoothly on high loads and with a high number of concurrent users. Traditional Java applications run blocking code and a common approach for scaling is to increase the number of available threads. When latency comes into the picture, many of these additional threads sit idle, wasting resources.

A different approach increases efficiency by writing asynchronous non-blocking code that lets the execution switch to another task while the asynchronous process completes.

Project Reactor is a Java framework from VMware that implements the [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) specification. This initiative provides a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure for the JVM and JavaScript runtimes. It is the foundation of the reactive stack in the Spring ecosystem and WebFlux applications. Some studies suggest that performance differences are negligible in Spring applications unless the application makes more than 500 API requests per second. Thus, it's not mandatory to do asynchronous programming, but it is the right approach for specific use cases.

In this post, we'll summarize some core Reactor concepts, introduce the Scheduler abstraction, and describe how it is used to encapsulate blocking code and prevent Java reactive applications from stalling.

## Reactor Execution Model

Reactor is an API for doing asynchronous programming. You describe your data processing as a flow of operators, composing a data-processing pipeline.

{% img blog/reactive-java/project-reactor.png alt:"Project Reactor Logo" width:"300" %}{: .center-image }

Using the assembly line analogy, the initial data flow from a source, known as the `Publisher`, goes through transformation steps and eventually the result is pushed to a consumer, known as the `Subscriber`. A `Publisher` produces data, and a  `Subscriber` listens to it. Reactor also supports flow control via backpressure, so a `Subscriber` can signal the volume it's able to consume.

### Nothing Happens Until You Subscribe

In general, when you instantiate a `Publisher` (a `Flux` or a `Mono`) you are describing an asynchronous processing pipeline. When combining operators, no processing happens–you are describing the intent. This is called **assembly time**. You only trigger the data flow through that pipeline when you `subscribe`. The `subscribe` call emits a signal back to the source, and the source starts emitting data that flows through the pipeline. This is called **execution time** or **subscription time**.

A **cold publisher** generates data for each subscription. Then, if you subscribe twice, it will generate the data twice. All the examples that follow below will instantiate cold publishers. On the other hand, a **hot publisher** starts emitting data immediately or on the first subscription. Late subscribers receive data emitted after they subscribe. For the family of hot publishers, something does indeed happen before you subscribe.

### Operators `map` and `flatMap`

Operators are like workstations in an assembly line. They make it possible to describe transformations or intermediate steps along the processing chain. Each operator is a *decorator*, it wraps the previous `Publisher` into a new instance. To avoid mistakes, **the preferred way of using operators is to chain the calls**. Apply the next operator to the last operator's result. Some operators are instance methods and others are static methods.

Both `map()` and `flatMap()` are instance method **operators**. You might be familiar with the concept of these operations from functional programming or Java Streams. In the reactive world, they have their own semantics.

The `map()` method transforms the emitted items by applying a **synchronous function** to each item, on a one-to-one basis. Check the example below:

```java
public class MapTest {

    private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MapTest.class);

    @Test
    public void mapTest() {
        Flux.range(1, 5)
                .map(v -> transform(v))
                .subscribe(y -> logger.info(y));

    }

    private String transform(Integer i){
        return  String.format("%03d", i);
    }
}
```

**Note:** You can find this test and all the code in this tutorial in [GitHub]( https://github.com/oktadev/okta-reactive-service-example).

In the code above, a flux is created from a range of integers from 1 to 5. The `map()` operator is passed a transformation function that formats with leading zeros. Notice that the return type of the transform method is not a publisher and the transformation is synchronous–a simple method call. The transformation function must not introduce latency.

The `flatMap()` method transforms the emitted items **asynchronously** into **Publishers**, then flattens these inner publishers into a single `Flux` through merging, and the items can interleave. This operator does not necessarily preserve original ordering. The mapper function passed to `flatMap()` transforms the input sequence into N sequences. **This operator is suitable for running an asynchronous task for each item.**

In the example below, a list of words is mapped to its phonetics through the Dictionary API, using `flatMap()`.

```java
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class FlatMapTest {

    private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FlatMapTest.class);

    public static class Word {

        private String word;
        private List<Phonetic> phonetics;
        private List<Meaning> meanings;

        public String getWord() {
            return word;
        }

        public void setWord(String word) {
            this.word = word;
        }

        public List<Phonetic> getPhonetics() {
            return phonetics;
        }

        public void setPhonetics(List<Phonetic> phonetics) {
            this.phonetics = phonetics;
        }

        public List<Meaning> getMeanings() {
            return meanings;
        }

        public void setMeanings(List<Meaning> meanings) {
            this.meanings = meanings;
        }
    }

    public static class Meaning {
        private String partOfSpeech;
        private List<Definition> definitions;

        public String getPartOfSpeech() {
            return partOfSpeech;
        }

        public void setPartOfSpeech(String partOfSpeech) {
            this.partOfSpeech = partOfSpeech;
        }

        public List<Definition> getDefinitions() {
            return definitions;
        }

        public void setDefinitions(List<Definition> definitions) {
            this.definitions = definitions;
        }
    }

    public static class Definition {
        private String definition;
        private String example;

        public String getDefinition() {
            return definition;
        }

        public void setDefinition(String definition) {
            this.definition = definition;
        }

        public String getExample() {
            return example;
        }

        public void setExample(String example) {
            this.example = example;
        }
    }

    public static class Phonetic {

        private String text;
        private String audio;

        public String getText() {
            return text;
        }

        public void setText(String text) {
            this.text = text;
        }

        public String getAudio() {
            return audio;
        }

        public void setAudio(String audio) {
            this.audio = audio;
        }
    }

    @Configuration
    public static class FlatMapTestConfig {

        @Bean
        public WebClient webClient(){

            WebClient webClient = WebClient.builder()
                    .baseUrl("https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en_US")
                    .build();

            return webClient;
        }
    }

    @Autowired
    private WebClient webClient;

    @Test
    public void flatMapTest() throws InterruptedException {

        List<String> words = new ArrayList<>();
        words.add("car");
        words.add("key");
        words.add("ballon");
        Flux.fromStream(words.stream())
                .flatMap(w -> getPhonetic(w))
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
                .subscribe(y -> logger.info(y));

        Thread.sleep(5000);
    }

    private  Mono<String> getPhonetic(String word){
        Mono<String> response = webClient.get()
                .uri("/" + word).retrieve().bodyToMono(Word[].class)
                .map(r -> r[0].getPhonetics().get(0).getText());

        return response;
    }
}
```
There is a rich vocabulary of operators for `Flux` and `Mono` you can find in the reference documentation. This handy guide can help you choose the right operator: ["Which operator do I need?"](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#which-operator).

# Reactor Schedulers for Switching the Thread

Project Reactor provides the tools for fine-tuning the asynchronous processing in terms of threads and execution context.

The `Scheduler` is an abstraction on top of the `ExecutionService`, which allows submitting a task immediately, after a delay or at a fixed time rate. We'll share some examples below of the various default schedulers provided. The execution context is defined by the `Scheduler` selection.

Schedulers are selected through `subscribeOn()` and `publishOn()` operators, they switch the execution context. `subscribeOn()` changes the thread where the source actually starts generating data. It changes the root of the chain, affecting the preceding operators, _upstream_ in the chain; and also affects subsequent operators.

Using `publishOn()` switches the context for the following operators in the pipeline description, _downstream_ in the chain, overriding any the scheduler assigned with `subscribeOn()`.

The scheduler examples ahead will use `TestUtils.debug` for logging the thread name, function, and element:

```java
public class TestUtils {

    public static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(TestUtils.class);

    public static <T> T debug(T el, String function) {
        logger.info("element "+ el + " [" + function + "]");
        return el;
    }
}
```
### No Execution Context

`Schedulers.immediate()` can be seen as the no-op scheduler, which the pipeline executes in the current thread.

```java
@Test
public void immediateTest() {

    logger.info("Schedulers.immediate()");

    Flux.range(1, 5)
            .map(v -> debug(v, "map"))
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.immediate())
            .subscribe(w -> debug(w,"subscribe"));
}
```

The test above will log something similar to:

```txt
2021-07-29 09:36:05.905 - INFO [main] - element "1" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "1" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "2" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "2" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "3" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "3" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "4" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "4" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "5" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "5" [subscribe]
```

Everything executes in the _main_ thread.

### Single Reusable Thread

```java
@Test
public void singleTest() throws InterruptedException {

    logger.info("Schedulers.single()");

    Flux.range(1, 5)
            .map(v -> debug(v, "map"))
            .publishOn(Schedulers.single())
            .subscribe(w -> debug(w,"subscribe"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}
```

When running the test above, you will see a log similar to this:

```txt
2021-07-13 23:19:16.456 - INFO [main] - element 1 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 2 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 3 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 4 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 5 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [single-1] - element 1 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.465 - INFO [single-1] - element 2 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.465 - INFO [single-1] - element 3 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.466 - INFO [single-1] - element 4 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.466 - INFO [single-1] - element 5 [subscribe]
```

As you can see, the `map()` function executes in the _main_ thread, and the consumer code passed to `subscribe()` executes in the _single-1_ thread. Everything after the `publishOn()` will execute in the passed scheduler.

You may have noticed there is a `Thread.sleep()` call at the end of the test. As part of the work is passed to another thread, the `sleep()` call delays the application exit, so the worker thread can complete the task.

### Bounded Elastic Thread Pool

A bounded elastic thread pool is a better choice for I/O blocking work, for example, reading a file, or making a blocking network call. **It serves to help with legacy blocking code if it cannot be avoided.**

```java
@Test
public void boundedElasticTest() throws InterruptedException {

    logger.info("Schedulers.boundedElastic()");

    List<String> words = new ArrayList<>();
    words.add("a.txt");
    words.add("b.txt");
    words.add("c.txt");
    Flux flux = Flux.fromArray(words.toArray(new String[0]))
            .publishOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
            .map(w -> scanFile(debug(w, "map")));

    flux.subscribe(y -> debug(y, "subscribe1"));
    flux.subscribe(y -> debug(y, "subscribe2"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}

public String scanFile(String filename){

    InputStream stream = getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(filename);
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(stream);
    String line = scanner.nextLine();
    scanner.close();

    return line;
}
```

The test above should log something similar to this:

```txt
2021-07-15 00:41:51.443 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "a.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.443 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "a.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.446 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "A line in file a.txt" [subscribe2]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.447 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "b.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.447 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "A line in file b.txt" [subscribe2]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.447 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "c.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.448 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "A line in file c.txt" [subscribe2]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.448 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "A line in file a.txt" [subscribe1]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.449 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "b.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.451 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "A line in file b.txt" [subscribe1]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.452 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "c.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.453 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "A line in file c.txt" [subscribe1]
```

As you can see in the code above, the `flux()` is subscribed twice. As the `publishOn()` is invoked before any operator, everything will execute in the context of a bounded elastic thread. Also, notice how the execution from both subscriptions can interleave.

What might be confusing is that each subscription is assigned one bounded elastic thread for the whole execution. So in this case, "subscription1" executed in _boundedElastic-1_ and "subscription2" executed in _boundedElastic-2_. All operations for a given subscription execute in the same thread.

The instantiation of the `Flux` above produced a **Cold Publisher**, a publisher that generates data anew for each subscription. That's why both subscriptions above process all the values.

### Fixed Pool of Workers

`Schedulers.parallel()` provides a pool of workers tuned for parallel work, with as many workers as there are CPU cores.

```java
@Test
public void parallelTest() throws InterruptedException {

    logger.info("Schedulers.parallel()");

    Flux flux = Flux.range(1, 5)
            .publishOn(Schedulers.parallel())
            .map(v -> debug(v, "map"));

    flux.subscribe(w -> debug(w,"subscribe1"));
    flux.subscribe(w -> debug(w,"subscribe2"));
    flux.subscribe(w -> debug(w,"subscribe3"));
    flux.subscribe(w -> debug(w,"subscribe4"));
    flux.subscribe(w -> debug(w,"subscribe5"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}
```

The test above will log something similar to the following lines:

```txt
2021-07-15 22:57:33.435 - INFO [parallel-2] - element "1" [map]
2021-07-15 22:57:33.435 - INFO [parallel-2] - element "1" [subscribe2]

2021-07-15 22:57:33.445 - INFO [parallel-4] - element "5" [subscribe4]
2021-07-15 22:57:33.445 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "3" [subscribe5]
2021-07-15 22:57:33.442 - INFO [parallel-3] - element "4" [subscribe3]
2021-07-15 22:57:33.450 - INFO [parallel-3] - element "5" [map]
2021-07-15 22:57:33.450 - INFO [parallel-3] - element "5" [subscribe3]
2021-07-15 22:57:33.450 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "4" [map]
2021-07-15 22:57:33.450 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "4" [subscribe5]
2021-07-15 22:57:33.450 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "5" [map]
2021-07-15 22:57:33.450 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "5" [subscribe5]
```

As you can see, different subscription executions interleave, and as I am testing with only four CPU cores, four workers seem to be available: _parallel-1_, _parallel-2_, _parallel-3_, and _parallel-4_. The `subscription5` operations, execute in _parallel-1_.

Again, observe how all operations for a given subscription are executed in the same thread.

### Using Both `publishOn` and `subscribeOn`

When the `publishOn()` and `subscribeOn()` operators are used, the `subscribe` call accepts a consumer. The consumer will execute in the context selected by `publishOn()`, which defines the scheduler for downstream processing, including the consumer execution. At first, this might be confusing to understand, so check the following example:

```java
@Test
public void subscribeOnWithPublishOnTest() throws InterruptedException {
    Flux.range(1, 3)
            .map(v -> debug(v, "map1"))
            .publishOn(Schedulers.parallel())
            .map(v -> debug(v * 100, "map2"))
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
            .subscribe(w -> debug(w,"subscribe"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}
```

The log should look like the following lines:

```
2021-07-29 08:40:30.583 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "1" [map1]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.584 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "100" [map2]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "100" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "2" [map1]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "200" [map2]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "200" [subscribe]
...
```

As you can see, the first `map()` operator executes in the _boundedElastic-1_ thread, the second `map()` operator and the `subscribe()` consumer execute in the _parallel-1_ thread. Notice that the `subscribeOn()` operator is invoked after `publishOn()`, but it affects the root of the chain and the operators preceding `publishOn()` anyways.

A probably simplified [marble diagam](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#howtoReadMarbles) for the example above might look like this:

## Reactive Java Spring Services

In Spring WebFlux, it is assumed applications don't block, so non-blocking servers use a small fixed-size thread pool to handle requests, named **event loop** workers.

In an ideal reactive scenario, all the architecture components are non-blocking, so there is no need to worry about the event loop freezing up (**reactor meltdown**). But sometimes, you will have to deal with legacy blocking code, or blocking libraries.

So now, let's experiment with Reactor Schedulers in a Reactive Java application. Create a Spring WebFlux service with Okta security. The service will expose an endpoint to return a random integer.

The implementation will call Java `SecureRandom` blocking code. Start by downloading a Spring Boot Maven project using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). You can do it with the following HTTPie command:

```shell
http -d https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  bootVersion==2.5.3 \
  baseDir==reactive-service \
  groupId==com.okta.developer.reactive \
  artifactId==reactive-service \
  name==reactive-service \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.reactive \
  javaVersion==11 \
  dependencies==webflux,okta
```

Unzip the project:

```shell
unzip reactive-service.zip
cd reactive-service
```

{% include setup/cli.md type="web" framework="Okta Spring Boot Starter" %}

Create the package `com.okta.developer.reactive.service`, and add the `SecureRandomService` interface:

```java
package com.okta.developer.reactive.service;

import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

public interface SecureRandomService {

    Mono<Integer> getRandomInt();
}
```

And the implementation `SecureRandomServiceImpl`:

```java
package com.okta.developer.reactive.service;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

import java.security.SecureRandom;

@Service
public class SecureRandomServiceImpl implements SecureRandomService {

    private SecureRandom secureRandom;

    public SecureRandomServiceImpl() {
        secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
    }

    @Override
    public Mono<Integer> getRandomInt() {
        return Mono.just(secureRandom.nextInt());
    }
}
```

Think for a moment about the `getRandomInt()` implementation. It's hard to resist the temptation to wrap anything whatsoever in a publisher. `Mono.just(T data)` creates a `Mono` that will emit the specified item. But the item is **captured at instantiation time**. This will invoke the blocking code at assembly time, perhaps in the context of an event loop thread.

For now, let's move forward to create the package `com.okta.developer.reactive.controller`, and add a `SecureRandom` class for the data:

```java
package com.okta.developer.reactive.controller;

public class SecureRandom {

    private String value;

    public String getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void setValue(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public SecureRandom(Integer value){
        this.value = value.toString();
    }
}
```
Create the `SecureRandomController` class:

```java
package com.okta.developer.reactive.controller;

import com.okta.developer.reactive.service.SecureRandomService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@RestController
public class SecureRandomController {

    @Autowired
    private SecureRandomService secureRandomService;


    @GetMapping("/random")
    public Mono<SecureRandom> getSecureRandom(){
        return secureRandomService.getRandomInt().map(i -> new SecureRandom(i));
    }
}
```

Add `spring-security-test` dependency to the pom:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Add a `SecureRandomControllerTest`:
```java
package com.okta.developer.reactive.controller;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.AutoConfigureWebTestClient;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.ActiveProfiles;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

import static org.springframework.security.test.web.reactive.server.SecurityMockServerConfigurers.mockOidcLogin;

@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class SecureRandomControllerTest {

    @Autowired
    private WebTestClient webTestClient;

    @Test
    public void testGetSecureRandom() {
        webTestClient.mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())
            .get()
            .uri("/random")
            .exchange()
            .expectStatus().isOk();
    }
}
```

Run with:
```shell
./mvnw test -Dtest=SecureRandomControllerTest
```
The test should pass, but **how can you make sure the REST call won't freeze up the service's event loop?** Use [BlockHound](https://github.com/reactor/BlockHound)!. Blockhound is a Java agent that detects blocking calls from non-blocking threads, has built-in integration with Project Reactor, and supports the JUnit platform.

Add the Blockhound dependency to the `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.projectreactor.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>blockhound-junit-platform</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.6.RELEASE</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

It has been reported that when [Spring Security is enabled, BlockHound does not detect blocking calls](https://github.com/reactor/BlockHound/issues/173).

Disable security for the test profile. Add the file `src/test/resources/application-test.yml` with the following content:

```
spring:
  autoconfigure:
    exclude:
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.client.reactive.ReactiveOAuth2ClientAutoConfiguration
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.resource.reactive.ReactiveOAuth2ResourceServerAutoConfiguration
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.reactive.ReactiveSecurityAutoConfiguration
```

Rerun the test, and you should see the following error:

```txt

```

As the log above shows, `SecureRandom.next()` produces a call to `FileInputStream.readBytes()`, which is blocking.

The `SecureRandomService` returns a `Mono` publisher, but it is an **Impostor Reactive Service**!

```java
return Mono.just(secureRandom.nextInt());
```

The implementation above has logic up front, first the calculation `secureRandom.nextInt()` and then the assembly.

What is the right way to wrap a blocking call? **Make the work happen in another scheduler.**

## Encapsulation of Blocking Calls

Blocking encapsulation needs to happen down into the service, as explained in the [Reactor documentation](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#faq.wrap-blocking). The scheduler assignment must also happen inside the implementation.

Create the class `SecureRandomReactiveImpl`.

```java
package com.okta.developer.reactive.service;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;
import reactor.core.scheduler.Schedulers;

import java.security.SecureRandom;

@Service
@Primary
public class SecureRandomReactiveImpl implements SecureRandomService {

    private SecureRandom secureRandom;

    public SecureRandomReactiveImpl() {
        secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
    }

    @Override
    public Mono<Integer> getRandomInt() {
        return Mono.fromCallable(secureRandom::nextInt)
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic());
    }
}
```

Run the test again and the BlockHound exception should not happen. Avoid the logic up front and assemble the pipeline. Everything should be fine.

Finally, let's do an end-to-end test. Run the application with Maven:

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/random` and you should see the Okta sign in page:

{% img blog/reactive-java/okta-login.png alt:"Okta Login Page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Sign in with your Okta account and you should see a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "value": "-611020335"
}
```
