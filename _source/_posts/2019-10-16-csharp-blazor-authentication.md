Curious what the experience would be like to trade in Javascript for C# on the front end? You are about to find out!

For many years, Javascript (and it's child frameworks) have had their run of the [DOM](https://css-tricks.com/dom/) (Document Object Model) in a browser, and it took having that scripting knowledge to really manipulate client-side UI. About 2 years ago, all of that changed with the introduction of Web Assembly - which allows compiled languages to be interpreted client-side and is fully supported across all browsers now. Microsoft's answer to this was the creation of [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor). Allowing C# developers to build their entire stack in .NET, including UI, was an exciting proposition. For some time Blazor has been in preview but is now included as a [general release](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0-preview-9/) on September 23rd, 2019 along with the next iteration of .NET Core - version 3.0.

In order to build with Blazor and ASP.NET Core 3.0, you need the following prerequisites installed and ready to go:

* [Visual Studio 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes), [Visual Studio 2019 for Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2019-mac-relnotes) (see the comparison [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/#vs_mac_table)) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (we will be using VS Code for the samples in this article since it runs on everything including Linux)
* [.NET Core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)
* [C# Intellisense extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp) (if using VS Code)
* An [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/) (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs)

## Build a Basic Website with ASP.NET Core 3.0 + Blazor

Now that you have your dev environment handy, let's get familiar with what a basic website walkthrough would be like. There are two ways you can utilize this technology: [client-side or server-side Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-3.0). For this example, the server-side option is the best choice for stability, as client-side Blazor is still new and working on the final release. Stay tuned for that implementation!

First, you'll need to create a Blazor project. As long as you've installed the [.NET Core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0), Visual Studio (16.3 or later) will detect that the templates have been installed and surface them to you without the need for any additional extensions. Now it's time to scaffold your new project. From your parent directory of code repositories, execute the following command:

```bash
dotnet new blazorserver -o OktaBlazorAspNetCoreServerSide
```

Once it's been run, open up the `OktaBlazorAspNetCoreServerSide` folder in Visual Studio Code. Once loaded, if you look in the bottom right-hand corner of the IDE you will see a permission request to add assets to the build. Select *Yes*.

Now that everything has been loaded up, return to your command line/terminal and run the project.

```bash
dotnet run
```

Launch your browser of choice and navigate to `https://localhost:5001`. You should see a templated website.

>NOTE: When you see the app running initially on HTTPS you may get a certificate error. See [this blog post](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DevelopingLocallyWithASPNETCoreUnderHTTPSSSLAndSelfSignedCerts.aspx) to resolve certificates locally.

## Add User Authentication your Blazor Web App

ASP.NET Core 3.0 has brought along with it some hefty changes to the libraries and dependencies from previous versions of .NET Core. To get started with using an external OAuth provider, like Okta, there is a NuGet package you need to add to the project. Fire up your command line/terminal window in VS Code and add the [Okta .NET SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-dotnet):

```bash
dotnet add package Okta.Sdk --version 1.4.0
```

In 3.0, ASP.NET Core ships as part of the .NET Core shared framework. The [metapackage](http://Microsoft.AspNetCore.App) that was used for 2.x apps is no longer used. The first line of your project file that references the Web SDK is what pulls in the shared assemblies for ASP.NET Core.

For user authentication with OAuth, there is an additional layer of information you will use, called Open ID Connect (OIDC). While much of handling authentication is [baked into the new 3.0 framework](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/issues/3755), OIDC is not included, so you'll need to add a quick reference to that.

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect --version 3.0.0-preview9.19424.4
```

Authentication works by redirecting users to the Okta website, where they will log in with their credentials, and then be returned to your site via the URL you will configure in the next section.
Add the following code to the very top of your `appsettings.json` file, inside of the first brackets, and separate it from the rest of the settings by adding a comma after it.

```json
"Okta": {
    "Issuer": "https://okta.okta.com/oauth2/default",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}"
  }
```

Your file should look like this:

{% img blog/csharp-blazor-authentication/json-settings.png alt:"screenshot of appsettings.json" width:"800" align:"center" %}

>NOTE: If necessary, edit the **Login redirect URL** and update it to include any ports you use to call it. Otherwise you get a 400 Bad Request from Okta. See this [documentation](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/The-redirect-uri-parameter-must-be-an-absolute-URI) to troubleshoot.

Just to make sure everything still can run, go ahead and execute `dotnet run` again.

## Set Up Your Okta Account to handle the ASP.NET Core 3.0 Blazor App

Execute the following steps to configure Okta so that users can register themselves for an account.
From the Administrative Dashboard, hover over Users and click **Registration**
Click **Enable Registration**
Save the changes
Once you have access to your account you can proceed to the Dashboard using a link like the one below:
`https://dev-12345.okta.com/admin/dashboard`
On the Dashboard, click **Applications** in the main menu and on the Application screen, click **Add Application**. Then select **Web** and click **Next**.

On the *Create New Application* screen, set the following values:

* Name: OktaBlazorAspNetCoreServerSide
* Base URIs: `https://localhost:5001/`
* Login redirect URIs: `https://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback`

Click **Done**, then click **Edit** next to General Settings on your newly created Okta app. Edit the following values:

-Logout redirect URIs: `https://localhost:5001/signout-callback-oidc`
-Initiate login URI: `https://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback`

{% img blog/csharp-blazor-authentication/okta-app-settings.png alt:"Okta application settings configuration" width:"800" align:"center" %}

Once you've saved those values, scroll down and take note of the **ClientID** and **ClientSecret**.

*ClientId* refers to the client ID of the Okta application *ClientSecret* refers to the client secret of the Okta application *Issuer* will need the text **{yourOktaDomain}** replaced with your Okta domain, found at the top-right of the Dashboard page.

You will use your Okta account settings to update those values in the `appsettings.json` file in your project. For an even more secure way to store those values, check out [this post](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/06/04/store-secrets-securely-int-dotnet-with-azure-keyvault) if you are using Azure to host your .NET Core app.

## Configure Your Blazor App to use Okta as the External Auth Provider

Great! Now that Okta has been configured and is ready to go, there are a few changes that need to be made to the application startup.

Add these using statements to your `Startup.cs` file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Logging;
```

Replace all the code in the `ConfigureServices` method with the code below.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRazorPages();
    services.AddServerSideBlazor();
    services.AddSingleton<WeatherForecastService>();

    services.AddAuthentication(sharedOptions =>
    {
        sharedOptions.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        sharedOptions.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        sharedOptions.DefaultSignOutScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        sharedOptions.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    })
    .AddOpenIdConnect(options =>
    {
        options.ClientId = Configuration["Okta:ClientId"];
        options.ClientSecret = Configuration["Okta:ClientSecret"];
        options.CallbackPath = "/authorization-code/callback";
        options.Authority = Configuration["Okta:Issuer"];
        options.ResponseType = "code";
        options.SaveTokens = true;
        options.Scope.Add("openid");
        options.Scope.Add("profile");
        options.TokenValidationParameters.ValidateIssuer = false;
        options.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType = "name";
    })
    .AddCookie();
}
```

ASP.NET Core 3.0 has new options to configure the services in this file. [*UseAuthorization*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio#mvc-service-registration) has been newly added to 3.0 project templates.

In the `Configure()` method of your `Startup.cs` file add this line just before the `app.UseEndpoints()` method:

```csharp
//Add Auth to app
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
```

Inside of the `app.UseEndpoints` object add the `MapControllers()` as shown.

```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    //Add MapControllers to app
    endpoints.MapControllers();
    endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
    endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
});
```

In this example, you'll see there's a new **UseEndpoints** method in `Startup.cs`. This is what enables the new endpoint routing system in ASP.NET Core. All 3.0 project templates use that now. Think of this as a more performant routing system.

>NOTE:
>In the context of Blazor apps, endpoint routing is the more holistic way of handling
>redirects. This is covered [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/routing) in depth.
>Also, see [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing) to learn more about it.
>Endpoint routing shipped in ASP.NET Core 2.2, but it didn't become the default in the templates until 3.0.

Now add a new folder at the top level called **Controllers** to your application. Next, add a new file called `LoginController.cs` and paste in the following code below:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace BlazorServerWithOkta.Controllers
{
    public class LoginController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet("Login")]
        public IActionResult Login([FromQuery]string returnUrl)
        {
            if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return LocalRedirect(returnUrl ?? Url.Content("~/"));
            }

            return Challenge();
        }

        [HttpGet("Logout")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Logout([FromQuery]string returnUrl)
        {
            if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return LocalRedirect(returnUrl ?? Url.Content("~/"));
            }

            await HttpContext.SignOutAsync();

            return LocalRedirect(returnUrl ?? Url.Content("~/"));
        }

        [HttpPost("Logout")]
        [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
        public IActionResult PostLogout([FromQuery]string returnUrl)
        {
            returnUrl ??= Url.Content("~/");
            returnUrl = Url.IsLocalUrl(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : Url.Content("~/");

            if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                HttpContext.SignOutAsync();
            }

            return LocalRedirect(returnUrl);
        }

    }
}
```

This **LoginController** contains all of the logic we need to do the routing based on the Identity model provided by default. Since the **LoginController** has been registered by convention via the `MapControllers()` method you previously added to the Startup file, your Blazor app will know how to reach it.

## Add User Login to your Blazor Web App UI

Time to add some user personalization to this app! Go inside the `Shared` folder and create a new file called LoginDisplay.razor. Paste in the code below:

```html
<AuthorizeView>
    <Authorized>
        <a href="#">Hello, @context.User.Identity.Name!</a>
        <a href="Logout">Logout</a>
    </Authorized>
    <NotAuthorized>
        <a href="Login">Log in</a>
    </NotAuthorized>
</AuthorizeView>
```

You've just created your first custom razor view! Let's use it in the existing app now. Open `Shared/MainLayout.razor` and add the LoginDisplay view right before the **About** link as shown below:

```html
<div class="top-row px-4">
    <LoginDisplay />
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/" target="_blank">About</a>
</div>
```

Using `<AuthorizeView>` is the easiest way to access authentication data, and is useful when you need to display a user's name.
The `<AuthorizeView>` component exposes a context variable of type *AuthenticationState*. It's useful to make the AccessToken returned by the identity provider available to the entire app's scope. In order to add this state to our app, open *App.razor* and wrap the HTML you see with `<CascadingAuthenticationState>` tags at the parent level. Replace all of the HTML with the snippet below to see the completed alteration:

```html
<CascadingValue Name="AccessToken" Value="AccessToken">
    <CascadingAuthenticationState>
        <Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly">
            <Found Context="routeData">
                <AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)" />
            </Found>
            <NotFound>
                <LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)">
                    <p>Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
                </LayoutView>
            </NotFound>
        </Router>
    </CascadingAuthenticationState>
</CascadingValue>
@code{
    [Parameter] public string AccessToken { get; set; }
}
```

## Test Okta Registration and Login for Your Blazor App

That's it! To test it out, go back to the command line/terminal and execute `dotnet run`.

Then navigate to `http://localhost:5001` in your browser. Click **Login** and you should be redirected to the Okta Sign-In Page.

{% img blog/csharp-blazor-authentication/blazor-app-hello-world-with-auth.png alt:"Screenshot of application with login header" width:"800" align:"center" %}

Because you configured your Okta org for self-registration, there should be an option at the bottom of the widget to allow users to register for a new account.

{% img blog/csharp-blazor-authentication/okta-sign-in-widget-registration.png alt:"Okta Sign-In Widget with New User registration turned on" width:"800" align:"center" %}

Now you have a website with a working login and user registration form. Your website also allows users to recover lost passwords. By repeating these steps you can create a network of tools that your users can access all with the same login.

All of that and *not one line of Javascript*. The future is looking bright for C#, give it a go with Blazor!

(Updated February 21st, 2020 to reflect the new changes with Blazor in .NET Core 3.0)
