You may not have heard of the Device Flow before, but you've probably used it if you have an Apple TV, Roku or Amazon FireTV! The OAuth 2.0 Device Flow is used to log in to a device using OAuth when the device doesn't have a browser, or also when the device has limited keyboard input ability.

The Apple TV is a great device, but it's missing a browser, which means it can't do a typical OAuth flow like you'd normally experience logging in to something on a computer or iPhone. What about passwords? Well, you probably wouldn't want everyone else in the living room watching as you slowly type your password on the screen character by character.

Instead, when you log in to an app on your Apple TV, you see a screen like this.

{% img blog/oauth-device-flow-proxy/syfy.jpg alt:"Syfy login screen on an AppleTV" width:800 %}{: .center-image }

It asks you to visit a URL on some other device and enter the code shown on the screen. Then you finish logging in on that other device, usually your phone. 

This has a number of benefits! It doesn't require a browser on the device, but it also means you don't have to deal with the awkward on-screen keyboard. Once you type this into your phone, you're then presented with a regular login screen, and if you have your passwords saved in your phone, or are already signed in, then it's even less typing.

This flow is also used by other kinds of devices, like the hardware video encoder below.

{% img blog/oauth-device-flow-proxy/teradek.jpg alt:"Logging in to Google on a Teradek video encoder" %}{: .center-image }

This device not only doesn't have a browser, it barely has a screen! Text entry on this device is also super awkward, and involves wiggling the little "menu" joystick to navigate the one-line on-screen keyboard. But it's still a very powerful device! Connect an HDMI video source like a video camera and it will push the video stream to Facebook or YouTube Live. 

So now that we know what the OAuth 2.0 Device Flow is, let's look at how it works.

## How the OAuth 2.0 Device Flow Works

The OAuth 2.0 Device Flow works quite different from the other OAuth flows, since it doesn't involve a browser redirect on the device.

When the user wants to log in, the device starts out by making a POST request to begin the process. The POST request contains only one piece of information, its `client_id`. (Devices like these are considered "public clients", so no `client_secret` is used in them, similar to [mobile apps](/blog/2019/01/22/oauth-api-keys-arent-safe-in-mobile-apps).) This request is made to a new endpoint that is unique to the Device Flow.

```
POST https://authorization-server.com/device

client_id={CLIENT_ID}
```

The server will respond with a JSON document with a few pieces of information.

```json
{
  "device_code": "NGU4QWFiNjQ5YmQwNG3YTdmZMEyNzQ3YzQ1YSA",
  "verification_uri": "https://example.com/device",
  "user_code": "BDSD-HQMK",
  "expires_in": 1800,
  "interval": 5
}
```

Here's what the properties in the response mean:

* `device_code` - This is a long string that the device will use to eventually exchange for an access token
* `verification_uri` - This is the URL the user needs to enter into their phone to start logging in
* `user_code` - This is the text the user will enter at the URL above
* `expires_in` - The number of seconds that this set of values is valid. After this amount of time, the `device_code` and `user_code` will expire and the device will have to start over
* `interval` - The number of seconds the device should wait between polling to see if the user has finished logging in

Now the device needs to display the URL and User Code to the user somehow. While the device waits for the user to enter the code and log in, it will make a POST request every 5 seconds as specified by the `interval` returned. This POST request will be made to the token endpoint, using a grant type of `device_code`.

```
POST https://authorization-server.com/token

grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code
&client_id=CLIENT_ID
&device_code=NGU4QWFiNjQ5YmQwNG3YTdmZMEyNzQ3YzQ1YSA
```

While the user is busy logging in on their phone, the token endpoint will return the error message below:

```json
{
  "error": "authorization_pending"
}
```

The `authorization_pending` error means the user isn't finished logging in, but the code hasn't yet expired either. The device should try this again after the specified number of seconds. Meanwhile the user will be logging in, choosing a YouTube account, and approving the request.

{% img blog/oauth-device-flow-proxy/device-flow-phone.png alt:"Device flow sequence on an iPhone" %}{: .center-image }

Finally, when the user finishes logging in, their phone will give them a "success" message, and there isn't anything left to do on the phone.

The next time the device makes the POST request to the token endpoint, it will get back an access token!

```json
{
  "access_token": "MsQ50jbzRn43NzqNLgV3Ia",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "b7aab34e37298a160e0ede5b43ed1f70a8"
}
```

The flow is complete, and the device can proceed to use the access token with the API!

## Use the Device Flow with a Server that Doesn't Support It

Now that you know how the Device Flow works, you see that it requires special support from the OAuth server to use it. At the moment, only a few OAuth services support this out of the box, Google being probably the largest deployment of it.

So what happens if you want to use the Device Flow with an API that doesn't support it natively? That's where this Device Flow Proxy Server comes into play. The Device Flow Proxy Server implements the parts specific to the Device Flow, but redirects the user out to whatever OAuth service you want. Let's set up an example using Okta.

This project is written in PHP to make it easy to deploy, so make sure you have PHP on your computer. (It's built-in to MacOS!) 

### Clone the Project from GitHub

Clone the project into a folder on your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronpk/Device-Flow-Proxy-Server.git
cd Device-Flow-Proxy-Server
```

We're using a few libraries, so you'll need to install them with Composer.

If you don't already have Composer installed, you can install it on Linux or MacOS with the command belo:

```bash
curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aaronpk/436bbfcf57644f1c8d6a230326c546bd/raw/8eac46272051f4bc965d4021300c9b21534408a6/install-composer.sh | bash
```

(Or visit [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/download/) for instructions on other platforms.)

Then you can install this project's dependencies, using either

```bash
composer install
```

or 

```bash
php composer.phar install
```

depending on whether you've installed Composer globally or just in this folder.

Next, you'll need to configure the proxy server to talk to Okta's OAuth server. If you're following this tutorial with a different OAuth server, it should work just fine. This proxy server needs to know two things: where to send the user to authenticate with the real OAuth server (the authorization endpoint), and where to get access tokens from (the token endpoint). These are defined in the project's config file.

Copy the `config.template.php` file to `config.php`. There are two URLs in there you'll need to configure for your Okta account.

### Create an Okta Developer Account

Create a free Okta Developer account at [developer.okta.com/signup](https://developer.okta.com/signup/). From the **Applications** tab, click **Add Application**. Then choose the **Native** option. Remember, like iOS and Android apps, you can't trust these devices to keep secrets, so this enables the PKCE flow for this application.

{% img blog/oauth-device-flow-proxy/create-new-app.png alt:"Create a new Okta app" %}{: .center-image }

Choose a name for the app, and set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`.

{% img blog/oauth-device-flow-proxy/app-settings.png alt:"Set the application settings" %}{: .center-image }

Once you create the app, you'll get a `client_id` for it. Copy that somewhere as you'll need it in a bit.

{% img blog/oauth-device-flow-proxy/app-credentials.png alt:"Find your application's client_id" %}{: .center-image }

Next, navigate to the **API** tab and choose **Authorization Servers**. You'll see an authorization server that's been created for your account.

{% img blog/oauth-device-flow-proxy/api-authorization-server.png alt:"Find the authorization server URL" %}{: .center-image }

Copy the Issuer URI that you see there, and use it as the base URL for your two endpoints to configure in the config file, adding `/v1/authorize` and `/v1/token` to the end. For example, if your Issuer URI is `https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default`, then the two URLs in your config file would be:

```php
public static $authEndpoint = 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize';
public static $tokenEndpoint = 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token';
```

### Run the PHP Server and Try it Out!

At this point, you should be ready to try it out! Open up a terminal, and from the project folder, run the PHP built-in web server to start it:

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t public
```

Now you have a server listening on port 8080! Don't open your browser there just yet, since remember we have to have the device initiate the OAuth request.

You can simulate a browserless device by interacting with the proxy server from the command line. In another terminal, make the following `curl` request to begin the Device Flow. Replace `{yourClientId}` with the client ID you got when creating the app above.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/device/code -d client_id={yourClientId}
```

You'll get back a JSON response from this special device endpoint, which will instruct you what to do next.

```json
{
    "device_code": "2e4be0865137c1d695b134c3e47ab968fe2e485ed57afb0990798353b9ea3d62",
    "user_code": "TVMC-CEWX",
    "verification_uri": "http://localhost:8080/device",
    "expires_in": 300,
    "interval": 5
}
```

Remember the device will need to poll for the response. You can make the first poll request by running the following command to make a POST request to our proxy's token endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/device/token -d client_id={yourClientId} -d device_code={yourDeviceCode} -d grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code
```

Remember to replace `{yourClientId}` and `{yourDeviceCode}` with the values specific to your flow.

Open `http://localhost:8080/device` in your browser, and you'll see a prompt asking you to enter the `user_code`. Go ahead and type that in now. (You can enter it with or without the hyphen, and in upper or lower case, the proxy server will normalize the input.)

{% img blog/oauth-device-flow-proxy/user-code-prompt.png alt:"The proxy server prompt to enter the user code" %}{: .center-image }

If you're already signed in to Okta, you won't even see the OAuth prompt, and you'll be redirected back immediately to the proxy.

{% img blog/oauth-device-flow-proxy/proxy-complete.png alt:"You successfully signed in!" %}{: .center-image }

Now back in the terminal, go ahead and repeat the same POST request you made before. (You can type up arrow and enter to repeat the last command.)

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/device/token -d client_id=0oaibdcprjlBnVOd60h7 -d device_code=9069166b78f96e64b8a6e0511cad353f390e359880c9182a791436d8da5cfb2b -d grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code
```

This time, you'll get back a JSON response containing an access token from Okta!

```json
{
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJWNnRfLUVHNC1NV3FTTW5mdHFteTJpV0p4SkxaanN6VHBFdWp0ZG5kaGZVIiwiYWxnIjoiUlMyNTYifQ.eyJ2ZXIiOjEsImp0aSI6IkFULnZNVUhydDVsNG5SekFkUWd4UjllRUhzM2FMTHBieFBPZDFLd0tBUmwtNEEiLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2Rldi00NDI0NDkub2t0YXByZXZpZXcuY29tL29hdXRoMi9kZWZhdWx0IiwiYXVkIjoiYXBpOi8vZGVmYXVsdCIsImlhdCI6MTU1MDI3NzcxMywiZXhwIjoxNTUwMjg0OTEzLCJjaWQiOiIwb2FpYmRjcHJqbEJuVk9kNjBoNyIsInVpZCI6IjAwdWJ1NG1sNWNBWUdod2dxMGg3Iiwic2NwIjpbImluZm8iXSwic3ViIjoiYWFyb25AcGFyZWNraS5jb20ifQ.kKoks1ZhoZ0yLJkWqeAH_klyLvpK6wUbf2Zo-1n15eIf1Mwiae-DEsuHcnGXNKlRblL7O7GjZIJGDBhweirp5kmzErvDF7FSHwqs-mRAEArSDt4-JN91R9sqDnngR24lRuixC9j-u1a15y3r31Cl7Cpv04VHQ12hLfDY4H6bLdEyD9s915FI1vHGSBZEhB_FktJRILTtaLUuFDLXVnX8-Dg-u1wgYQSa8Ier89I4u-6d-hSTtv6txNUnBukI01w85sdEwE7S1Wh_LfHR1So-Z6956mmj7RXNNq36XcKW2vVS2Lk3Q3O94SLqtFWIdl8AhuAyN4S-Lab1lhWvTQev7A",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 7200
}
```

At this point, the Device Flow is complete and your device can use the access token to make API requests!

### Try the Interactive Command Line Version

If you want to see a more realistic version of this that more closely emulates doing this on a real device, check out the `client.php` script in the repository. You can run this from PHP by passing your `client_id` to the script:

```bash
php client.php {yourClientId}
```

The script will show you the URL and `user_code` (and will even pre-fill the code in the URL so that you don't need to type it in!)

```
Please visit this URL in your browser, and confirm the code in the browser matches the code shown:
http://localhost:8080/device?code=KFMM-HDHJ
KFMM-HDHJ
```

The script will poll the token endpoint waiting for you to finish logging in, after which it will show you the successful message and the access token!

```
You successfully logged in!
Here is the access token returned from the server:

## Learn More about OAuth, the Device Flow, and Okta

Hopefully, this gives you an idea of how to use the Device Flow with an OAuth server that doesn't have native support. In a production environment, you'd want to do some cleanup to the UI that the user interacts with to make it look a bit nicer, but this is a good starting point!

You can find the entire source code for this project [on GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpk/Device-Flow-Proxy-Server).
