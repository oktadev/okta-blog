Authorization is the oft-forgotten piece of identity and access management. The fact is, almost every app needs more than just "are they signed in?" for authorization. Most times, you need to not only know _who_ "they" are, but what access they are supposed to have. For instance, "are they in the administrator group?" or "are they in a group with some special privileges?" Today, you'll learn how to do this with Okta in an ASP.NET Core MVC application.

In the Okta world, users are separated into `Groups`. By default however, ASP.NET only has handling for the `Authorize` attribute to handle authorization using `Roles`. There are a couple of ways you could go about handling authorization using the `Groups` that come from Okta:

* You can write your own custom `AuthorizeAttribute` and have it looks at groups instead of roles.
* You can map the `Groups` to `Roles` claims and let the regular ASP.NET `AuthorizeAttribute` handle authorization

This second approach is far easier to implement, so that's the approach this article will take.

Start by cloning the application at <https://github.com/oktadeveloper/aspnetcore-oidc-okta-example>. This is the base application with authentication covered in [my previous post](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/29/oidc-user-auth-aspnet-core). You'll add authorization to this application.

## Let ASP.NET Know Where Your Roles Are
In the `startup.cs` file, where the `OpenIdConfigurationOptions` are set, one of the items being set is the `TokenValidationParameters`. In the new `TokenValidationParameters` add a property called `RoleClaimType` with a value of `ClaimTypes.Role`. This is an enumeration in the `System.Security.Claims` namespace that holds the URL that describes the "role" claim type. Ultimately, your `TokenValidationParameters` property should look like this.

``` csharp
TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
{
  ValidateIssuer = true,
  RoleClaimType = ClaimTypes.Role
}
```

## Add a Claims Transformer
The [Claims Tranformer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.iclaimstransformation) is a way to manipulate the [ClaimsPrincipal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.claims.claimsprincipal(v=vs.110).aspx), which is the main user in your ASP.NET application, once the user is authenticated.

Add a folder inside the `Domain` folder called `Authorization`. Then add a class called `GroupsToRolesTransformer`. The contents of the transformer should be:

``` csharp
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Okta.Sdk;
using Okta.Sdk.Configuration;

namespace AspnetOkta.Domain.Authorization
{
  public class GroupsToRolesTransformer : IClaimsTransformer
  {
    private OktaClient client;

    public GroupsToRolesTransformer()
    {
        client = new OktaClient(new OktaClientConfiguration{
            OrgUrl = "https://{yourOktaDomain}",
            Token = "JiBBerJabbER"
        });
    }

    public async Task<ClaimsPrincipal> TransformAsync(ClaimsTransformationContext context)
    {
      var idClaim = context.Principal.FindFirst(x=>x.Type == ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier);
      if(idClaim != null)
      {
          var user = await client.Users.GetUserAsync(idClaim.Value);
          if(user != null){
            var groups = user.Groups.ToEnumerable();
            foreach (var group in groups)
            {
                ((ClaimsIdentity)context.Principal.Identity).AddClaim(new Claim(ClaimTypes.Role, group.Profile.Name));
            }
          }
      }
      return context.Principal;
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see here, in the constructor, you are creating an `OktaClient` object to be stored in a class-level variable called client. You'll need your org URL from Okta and an API token which you can get from the Okta Developer Dashboard under API > Tokens.

{% img blog/aspnet-authz/tokens.png alt:"API Token Page" width:"800" %}

_Be aware that you only get to see the API token when you create it, so make sure you save it somewhere so you can reference it later._

Once you've created a transformer, it will implement the `IClaimsTransformer` interface. There is only one method you'll need to worry about, and that's the `TransformAsync` method. It takes a `ClaimsTransformationContext` and returns a `Task` with a `ClaimsPrincipal` in it.

_Note that if you use the key shortcuts to get Visual Studio (or Visual Studio Code) to implement the interface for you, it will not add the `public` or `async` keywords to the signature. You'll have to add them manually._

In this method, you'll get the currently authenticated user's `NameIdentifier` property. This is the ID you'll use to get the Okta user so that you can get their groups. Just a quick null check for the `idClaim` variable and then go and get the `Groups` from the `user` object. From there, simply loop through the `Groups` and add a `Claim` using the `ClaimTypes.Role` enumeration and using the `group.Profile.Name` for the value of the claim.

Return the context.Principal no matter what. If you didn't find the user's identifier, or get a user back from the `GetUserAsync` call, at least the application will still get the `ClaimsPrincipal` back into the flow of the application.

## Tell the Application to Use Your Transformer
The only thing left is to configure your application to use the new transformer in your middleware pipeline.

Right below the OIDC setup in the `Configure` method of your `startup.cs` file, add the following code:

```csharp
app.UseClaimsTransformation(new ClaimsTransformationOptions{
  Transformer = new GroupsToRolesTransformer()
});
```
This tells the application that you want to transform the claims and which claims transformer you want to use.

## Prove that it Works
You'll need to set up two users in two different groups in your Okta Developer Dashboard, call one group "Admin" and the other "Enthusiast".

{% img blog/aspnet-authz/add-groups.png alt:"Add Groups Page" width:"800" %}

Make sure the groups are assigned to your application:

{% img blog/aspnet-authz/group-assignments.png alt:"Assing Groups To Application" width:"800" %}

Then create some routes in the `UserController` decorated with the `AuthorizeAttribute`.

```csharp
  [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
  public IActionResult AdminOnly()
  {
    return View();
  }

  [Authorize(Roles = "Enthusiast")]
  public IActionResult EnthusiastOnly()
  {
    return View();
  }
```

Then create matching views for those routes.

_AdminOnly.cshtml_
```html
<h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>
```

_EnthusiastOnly.cshtml_
```html
<h1>Enthusiast Dashboard</h1>
```

Now you should be able to run your application, log in as a user in the "Admin" group, and go to the `http://localhost:5000/User/AdminOnly` route successfully. The `EnthusiastOnly` route should return an unauthorized error.

Log back out and log in as a member of the "Enthusiast" group and go to the `http://localhost:5000/User/EnthusiastOnly` URL, and you should be able to get to it.

Congratulations! You just added authorization to you .NET application! Not only can users get into your application, but you can make sure they have access to the data and functionality they need!
