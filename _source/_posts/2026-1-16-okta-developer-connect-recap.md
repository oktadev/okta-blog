Identity has become one of the most important control points in modern systems. As applications grow more distributed and AI-driven automation becomes part of everyday workflows, identity increasingly defines how secure, predictable, and trustworthy those systems are. Decisions about access, scope, and lifecycle now shape not only the user experience, but also how well security holds up as systems scale.

With this shift in mind, we hosted our first flagship **[Okta Developer Connect event](https://regionalevents.okta.com/oktadeveloperconnect)** in India, in Bengaluru. Led by the Okta Developer Advocacy team, the event brought together developers, architects, engineering managers, IAM practitioners, and technology leaders for a day of focused conversations on how identity needs to evolve as systems scale, and as AI agents begin to act alongside humans. 



## Where identity, security, and AI connect

Throughout the day, the theme stood out clearly: identity now sits at the intersection of application architecture, security decisions, and system behavior. As organizations integrate across ecosystems and introduce AI-driven workflows, identity increasingly determines how safely systems interact and how confidently access can be controlled.

Identity was discussed as foundational infrastructure, spanning users, applications, APIs, services, and AI agents. The conversations focused on how identity decisions ripple across systems as they become more interconnected, and why those decisions matter long after the first sign-in.

The sessions balanced identity fundamentals with how teams are applying them today. Core identity standards and practices were discussed as the foundation for building secure, interoperable systems that scale. From there, the conversations expanded into modern use cases across Okta's platform, including identity for AI-driven systems using the Okta MCP Server, Cross App Access, secure integrations through the Okta Integration Network, automation with Okta Workflows, lifecycle management, and emerging capabilities such as Verifiable Digital Credentials.

## A shared conversation with the community
Beyond the talks, Okta Developer Connect was intentionally designed to be interactive, with open discussions, audience Q&A, quizzes, interactive sessions, surveys, and a research panel created space for participation beyond listening. Attendees engaged directly with Okta engineers, product leaders, and advocates, exchanging perspectives shaped by the systems they build and operate. Those exchanges added important context to the day, grounding the conversations in real systems and practical implementations.

## Looking ahead
Okta Developer Connect Bengaluru marked the beginning of an ongoing series focused on practical identity education and open technical dialogue. The series aims to help teams think more clearly about building enterprise-ready systems, how identity standards and practices are reflected across the stack, and how AI-driven systems impact access and security assumptions. 

As identity continues to sit at the intersection of security, system architecture, and AI-driven automation, these conversations will only become more important.

We're excited to continue building this forum with the developer community, grounded in standards, informed by real-world systems, and focused on designing identity that scales with what comes next.
