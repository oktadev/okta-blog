FastAPI is really fast and SQLAlchemy is really...SQL-y. But what good is a fast and SQL-y application if it isn't **secure**?

In this post, we're going to show you how to secure a fast and SQL-y app!

First we will need some _authentication_, which is how we identify
**who** the user is. We'll use Okta for this.

Next, we'll want to perform _authorization_, which controls **what** the user can do in our application. We'll be using [Oso][] for that, which is a batteries-included library for authorization.

This post is intended for people who have some familiarity with both FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. By the end of the post, you will know how to make sure users have access to the things they need - and only the things they need.

The full example is available on [GitHub][]. Clone the repo and follow along!

## Bear Management Service Architecture

What, you expected TodoMVC?

Our app allows authenticated users to register their own bears and view the bear population at large. It consists of two separate services: (1) a front end through which users authenticate with Okta, and (2) a back end that exposes an extensive API for creating and retrieving bears.

## Set Up Okta

{% include setup/cli.md type="spa" framework="React" loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080/login/callback" logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080" %}

Once your new Okta application is created, the Okta CLI will print out its `Issuer` and `Client ID` properties:

```console
$ okta apps create

...

Okta application configuration:
Client Id:     <YOUR CLIENT ID>
Issuer:        https://<YOUR OKTA DOMAIN>/oauth2/default
```


Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory with the following contents:

```ini
CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>
ISSUER=https://<YOUR OKTA DOMAIN>/oauth2/default
AUDIENCE=api://default
```

After creating the `.env` file in the project root, symlink it into the `okta-hosted-login` subdirectory so that both the front end and back end projects have access to the same configuration parameters:

```console
$ ln -s ../.env okta-hosted-login/.env
```

## Start the React Front End

In the `okta-hosted-login` directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies and then `npm start` to fire up the React front end.

Once the app is up and running, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. Click the `Login` button and enter your Okta credentials when prompted. Successfully signing in should redirect you back to your front end, where you'll be greeted with your name (courtesy of Okta), a 'Create a new bear' form, and a list of bears:

{% img blog/oso-fastapi-sqlalchemy/image2.png alt:"Bear Management Service" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

The list will be empty because our back end service isn't running. Let's change that now.

## Start the FastAPI Back End

While the React app runs happily in the background, open a new terminal and `cd` to the project's root directory. In the root, create and activate a new virtual environment, and then install dependencies:

```console
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, start the FastAPI server:

```console
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --reload-dir=app
```

If you reload `http://localhost:8080`, you should see the list of bears populated with a number of very good bears owned by various members of Example.com, Inc:

{% img blog/oso-fastapi-sqlalchemy/image1.png alt:"Bear Management Service" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Go ahead and create a few new bears of your own.

Our app is now open for business. In fact, it's  _too_ open. Every authenticated user can see everyone's bears â€” even users who have been banned for trying to create koalas. It's time to put a stop to this madness.

## ABAC, As Easy as 1-2-3 ðŸ•º

**Oso** is an [open source][osohq/oso]
authorization system that we'll use to secure our app. Oso is flexible enough to support [any access control pattern your heart desires][patterns], but for this example we'll focus on [attribute-based access control (ABAC)][abac].

ABAC is all about representing fine-grained or dynamic permissions based on who the user is and their relation to the resource they want to access.

### The Bear Necessities

First, after pressing Ctrl+C to exit FastAPI, we're going to install the `oso` and `sqlalchemy-oso` packages:

```console
pip3 install oso sqlalchemy-oso
```

Once pip finishes pipping, open up `app/main.py` using your favorite text editor and make the changes that you see below. The following is a [Git diff][] of the change â€” if you're following along, add the lines that start with a single `+` symbol to your local copy of `app/main.py`:

```

Next, create an empty Oso policy file in the `app` directory:

```console
touch app/policy.polar
```

This is where we are going to write all of our authorization logic
using Oso's declarative policy language called Polar.

Load the new policy file into our Oso instance in `app/main.py`:

```diff

Before we start filling that policy file with authorization rules, we first need to register the application data types that we're going to use in our authorization policy with Oso. Registering the application types allows us to reference them in our Polar policy as [specializers][].

We're going to use the `register_models()` helper from the `sqlalchemy-oso` library to register our SQLAlchemy models with Oso in bulk. `register_models()`
registers all descendants of a SQLAlchemy base class with Oso; otherwise, we would have to call `oso.register_class()` for each individual class that we wanted to register:

```diff

In addition, let's register the `BearBase` Pydantic model that's used in the `create()` handler. Again, registering the class allows us to refer to it in our Polar policy as a [specializer][specializers]:

```diff

+        raise HTTPException(403)

If you save `app/main.py` and then try to create a new bear, the `POST` request will return a `403 Forbidden`.

{% img blog/oso-fastapi-sqlalchemy/image3.png alt:"403 Forbidden" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Oso is deny-by-default, and we currently have an empty policy file. In the next section, we'll write our first authorization rule to allow real bear lovers to create real bears.

### Add Your First `allow()` Rule

For our first foray into writing a policy, we're going to use Polar to add a rule that prevents banned users from creating new bears.

Open up `app/policy.polar` and add the following rule:

```polar
allow(user: User, "create", _bear: BearBase) if
    not user.is_banned;
```

The rule works by matching the inputs provided by the application:

- `user` - an instance of the `User` class.
- The action is the string literal `"create"`.
- `_bear` - an instance of the `BearBase` class.

And then checking that the provided user's `is_banned` field is false.
We don't yet need to check anything further about the `bear` resource,
so we prefix it with an underscore to indicate that it won't be referenced in the body of the rule.

**NOTE:** To learn more about Polar syntax, head on over to [the Writing Policies guide][learn/policies] in [the Oso documentation][docs.osohq.com].

Save the file, flip back to [localhost:8080][], and you should once again be able to create new bears (assuming you haven't set your own user's `is_banned` property to `True`). All law-abiding bear enthusiasts have had their access restored, and the koala lovers are left out in the cold. (Does it get cold in Australia? We'll investigate in a future blog.)

### Deal with List Endpoints

`oso.is_allowed()` worked perfectly for securing the `create()` endpoint, but it's not the best tool for the job when it comes to securing `index()`. The difference is that `create()` operates over a single record, while `index()` operates over a potentially very large collection. If performance weren't an issue, we could load the collection from the database and iterate over it,
calling `oso.is_allowed()` on every record to filter out unauthorized entries. However, we all know that Zoomers lose interest and click away from your website if it takes longer than a few Planck time units to load, so we need a better solution.

And now, presenting... a better solution. Data filtering! The cure to all of life's performance issues.

The `sqlalchemy-oso` library is built on top of Oso's data filtering feature. In a nutshell, the logic engine at the core of the Oso library can turn your authorization policy into a set of constraints similar to the `WHERE` clauses used to filter records when querying a relational database. The `sqlalchemy-oso` library then applies those constraints directly to your app's SQLAlchemy queries. In this way, only authorized records are loaded from the database in an efficient operation instead of loading all records and then iterating over the collection to determine the authorized subset.

Without further ado, let's wire up our app so that we can efficiently filter some bears.

First, we need to modify `app/main.py` to import `authorized_sessionmaker()` from the `sqlalchemy-oso`
library:

```diff
diff --git a/app/main.py b/app/main.py

+++ b/app/main.py

-from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models
+from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models, authorized_sessionmaker
```

Next, we'll create a new [FastAPI dependable][] that mirrors our existing `get_db()` function but yields an Oso [AuthorizedSession][] instead of a regular SQLAlchemy [Session][]. To do this, add the following code below the `get_db()` function in `app/main.py`:

```diff
diff --git a/app/main.py b/app/main.py
index f2a17d0..1fa9573 100644

```

And finally, update the `index()` handler so that it depends on our new `get_authorized_db()` dependable:

```

Save the file, reload [localhost:8080][], and... no bears. They're still happily growling away in the database, but we haven't added any Oso rules permitting access. Let's change that.

### Flesh Out Your Authorization Policy

To start off, let's add a rule to `app/policy.polar` that permits all users to list all bears:

```polar
allow(_: User, "index", _: Bear);
```

Save the file, reload [localhost:8080][], and you should see every bear again. But something else is missing. The `Owner` column is empty! When we serialize bear records in the back end, we include the email address for each bear's owner â€” a piece of data that comes from our SQLAlchemy-backed `User` model. Access to `User` data is now protected by Oso because `User` is a subclass of the `Base` SQLAlchemy class we registered via `sqlalchemy-oso`'s `register_models()` method. Let's add one more blanket `allow()` rule, this time permitting users to view user data at the `index()` endpoint:

```polar
allow(_: User, "index", _: User);
```

Do the save-and-reload dance, and the `Owner` column should once again be populated.

Next, let's add some constraints to our `"index"` rule for bears so we can see *Data Filtering in Action* (coming soon from Manning, probably).

Perhaps users should only be allowed to see their own bears:

```diff
diff --git a/app/policy.polar b/app/policy.polar
index ff90780..0a1a77d 100644
--- a/app/policy.polar
+++ b/app/policy.polar

-allow(_: User, "index", _: Bear);
+allow(user: User, "index", bear: Bear) if
+    bear.owner = user;
```

Save, reload, and confirm you can no longer see anyone else's bears. If you want to see some bears, you'll need to create them for yourself.

The index view is now private, but it feels _wrong_ to prevent our fellow bear enthusiasts from viewing polar bears, the sweetest and most mild-mannered of all bears. To right that wrong, we can register the `Species` enum as a constant so that we can reference it in our policy:

```diff

Then, update said policy:

Well, that's about all we can _bear_ (sorry) for one blog. Let's take stock and wrap up.

## Learn More About Oso, FastAPI, and Python

In this post, we started out with a very fast and SQL-y application built on FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. We created and configured a new Okta application to handle identity management and authentication for our app. Then we used Oso to add efficient, fine-grained authorization to our back end API.

The full example is available on [GitHub][].

If you're up for it, here are a couple exercises to try:

- Add roles to the app using `sqlalchemy-oso`'s [built-in roles][] feature.
  Perhaps every bear lives in a sanctuary, and a user can have a particular
  role in each sanctuary, e.g., "Visitor", "Friend", or "Shepherd".
- Add a "Delete" button next to every bear in the list, and wire up each button to send
  a DELETE request to the back end. Secure your new `delete()` handler with
  Oso, and add a rule to the policy that only allows users to delete their own
  bears.
- Join [our slack][slack] and let us know what your favorite bear is and why
  it's the polar bear.
- Learn more about other use cases of Oso, other languages it supports,
  and more in [the Oso documentation][docs.osohq.com].
