[Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) calls itself *the intuitive Vue framework*. It aims to make a developer-friendly experience while not sacrificing performance or degrading the integrity of your architecture. It has been exciting to see the community and tooling around VueJS grow and evolve â€” there's no better time to get started in this ecosystem than now.   

In this tutorial, you will build a small web application that retrieves some posts from an API and displays them for authenticated users. For authentication, you will integrate Okta into your Nuxt application. Okta's simple authentication system and the power of Nuxt means you can configure and set up your authentication in just a few moments.  

{% img blog/vue-applications-nuxt/vue-nuxt-social.jpg alt:"Cover image with a screenshot of the finished Nuxt app." width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

**What you'll need**

- Your favorite IDE (I will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- An [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)
- The [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com/) tool

## Set up your Okta application

{% include setup/cli.md type="spa" framework="Vue"
   loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000/login" logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000/" signup="false" %}

## Build your web application with Nuxt

If you wish to follow along using the completed project you can [check out the GitHub repository here](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-vue-nuxt-example).  

Nuxt provides a scaffolding tool called `create-nuxt-app` to make scaffolding your application easy. You can run the following command to create the application:  

```bash
npx create-nuxt-app okta-vue-nuxt-example
```

Usually, task runners have several options. There are some important options you should take a look at while using this task runner. 
- Programming language: **JavaScript**
- Package manager: **Npm**
- UI framework: **Bootstrap Vue**
- Nuxt modules: **Axios - Promise based HTTP client**

We will use Axios to fetch data in our application. Next, you can select the linting tool of your choice and a testing framework. 

- Rendering mode: **Universal (SSR / SSG)**
- Deployment target: **Server (Node.js hosting)**

You can use the following commands to enter the project directory and run the application.

```bash
cd okta-vue-nuxt-example
npm run dev
``` 

If you open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser, you will see the default Nuxt page.

{% img blog/vue-applications-nuxt/nuxt-default-page.png alt:"The default Nuxt page." width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

The Nuxt project layout is pretty straightforward. First you have a `.nuxt` folder where your compiled server code will end up. Next there is a `components` folder. You won't use the folder in this tutorial, but breaking pages into components is common practice in larger projects. These components are then reusable in a number of pages. Next you will find a `pages` folder where your pages will go. Your routes will be inferred by Nuxt from these views. The `static` folder is where you can house css, images, or other static content to display. The store directory contains your [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) store files.  

You will also add a `layouts` folder later.  As you might have guessed, this folder will contain layouts. There are several other directories that are configured out of the box for Nuxt, including middleware, modules, plugins, and dist.  These are out of scope for this article but it is important to know they exist.

Finally, you will need two packages from npm. The first is `@nuxtjs/dotenv` which is a nuxt-friendly implementation of dotenv. You will use this to store sensitive information that you don't want to end up in your source control. 

Finally you will need `@nuxt/auth-next` to control your authentication.

```console
npm i @nuxtjs/dotenv@1.4.1
npm i @nuxtjs/auth-next@5.0.0-1637333559.35dbd53
```

With your dependencies installed it's time to start building your application. First, add a new file to your root directory and name it `.env`, then add the following code to it.

```bash
OKTA_DOMAIN=https://{yourOktaDomain}
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
```

Be sure to replace the placeholder variables with your actual Okta information.

Now open your `nuxt.config.js` file located in the root directory and replace its contents with the following code.

```javascript
export default {
  // Global page headers: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-head
  head: {
    title: "todolist-article",
    htmlAttrs: {
      lang: "en",
    },
    meta: [
      { charset: "utf-8" },
      { name: "viewport", content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1" },
      { hid: "description", name: "description", content: "" },
      { name: "format-detection", content: "telephone=no" },
    ],
    link: [{ rel: "icon", type: "image/x-icon", href: "/favicon.ico" }],
  },

  // Global CSS: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-css
  css: [],

  // Plugins to run before rendering page: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-plugins
  plugins: [],

  // Auto import components: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-components
  components: true,

  // Modules for dev and build (recommended): https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-modules
  buildModules: [],

  // Modules: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-modules
  modules: [
    // https://go.nuxtjs.dev/bootstrap
    "bootstrap-vue/nuxt",
    // Doc: https://axios.nuxtjs.org/usage
    "@nuxtjs/axios",
    "@nuxtjs/dotenv",
    "@nuxtjs/auth-next",
  ],

  /*
   ** Axios module configuration
   ** See https://axios.nuxtjs.org/options
   */
  axios: {},

  auth: {
    strategies: {
      okta: {
        scheme: "openIDConnect",
        endpoints: {
          configuration:  `${process.env.OKTA_DOMAIN}/oauth2/default/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`,
          logout: undefined,
        },
        clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
        grantType: "authorization_code",
        responseType: "code",
      },
    },
  },
  // Build Configuration: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-build
  build: {},
};
```

The first thing this file does is make use of dotenv. It registers the modules you added earlier through the task runner and via npm. Finally, it sets up the options for your OAuth configuration. Here is where you use the environment variables that you set up in your `.env` file.  

You should note the line of code that reads `logout: undefined`. It is critical for logging the user out correctly, because Okta requires the `idToken` to be passed as a query parameter. However, `nuxt-auth` won't include that parameter under the hood. The solution is to override the logout URL obtained from the configuration endpoint with `undefined` and manually log the user out in your page file. You will implement this shortly.

To use the OAuth configuration properly, Nuxt requires you to add a file to the `store` folder called `index.vue`. You can leave this file empty, but it must exist for Nuxt to use it. If you do not have a `store` folder, create one now and add a blank `index.vue` file to it.

### Add your Nuxt pages

Now, you can start adding pages to your application. Nuxt builds your routes by looking in the `pages` folder. You can read more about Nuxt's custom routing in their [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing).  

Before working on your pages you should set up your layout. Add a new folder called `layouts` to the project directory and add a file called `default.vue`.  

This file, and all of the views in this project, will use the Vue template syntax. Vue templating is very similar to most other template syntaxes. It relies heavily on the `v-bind` HTML attribute to handle events or bind attribute values. You can handle events with the `v-on` syntax, which can be short handed to `@`, such as `@click="doSomething"`.  The `b-*` components are from the `Bootstrap Vue` library that should have been installed via the npx task runner.

The layout page will display the headers and footers and incorporate some branching logic to determine if a user should see a `login` or `logout` button. It also contains some common CSS and JavaScript that will be needed on each page that uses the layout. The `<nuxt />` element on this page will act as a placeholder for the code on your page. Nuxt will render your page code in this section.

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <b-container>
      <b-navbar toggleable="lg" type="dark" variant="info">
        <b-navbar-brand href="#">Posts</b-navbar-brand>
        <b-navbar-nav>
          <b-nav-item href="/dashboard"> Dashboard </b-nav-item>
        </b-navbar-nav>

        <b-navbar-nav v-if="loggedIn" class="ml-auto">
          <b-button @click="logout" size="sm" class="my-2 my-sm-0" type="submit"
            >Logout
          </b-button>
        </b-navbar-nav>

        <b-navbar-nav v-else class="ml-auto">
          <b-button @click="login" size="sm" class="my-2 my-sm-0" type="submit"
            >Login
          </b-button>
        </b-navbar-nav>

      </b-navbar>

      <nuxt />

      <footer id="sticky-footer" class="py-4 bg-dark text-white-50">
        <div class="fluid-container footer">

          <br />

          >.
        </div>
      </footer>
    </b-container>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      loggedIn: this.$auth.$state.loggedIn,
      year: new Date().getFullYear(),
    }
  },
  methods: {
    logout() {
      this.$auth.logout();
    },
    login() {
      this.$auth.loginWith('okta').then(result => window.location = "/Dashboard");
    }
  },
}
</script>

<style scoped>
.fluid-container.footer > *:last-child {
  margin-bottom: 0px;
  color: #fff;
}
</style>
```
{% endraw %}

You will also need a basic landing page that isn't under authentication. Your landing page will give some information about the application. It will also contain a redirect for authenticated users to route them to the `Dashboard` page. 

Open the `index.vue` page in the `pages` directory and replace the code with the following.

```html
<template>
  <div id="page-content">
    <b-jumbotron
      style="margin-top: 5vh"
      header="Lets Get Some Posts"
      lead="A Simple App with Nuxt and Okta"
    >
      <p>For more information visit their websites</p>
      <b-button variant="primary" href="https://nuxtjs.org/" target="blank"
        >Nuxt</b-button
      >
      <b-button
        variant="outline-primary"
        href="https://www.okta.com/"
        target="blank"
        >Okta</b-button
      >
    </b-jumbotron>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  beforeMount() {
    if (this.$auth.$state.loggedIn) window.location = '/Dashboard'
  },
}
</script>
```

Next, you can add the `Dashboard` page. This page makes use of the `data()` webhook to get some data from a server using Axios, which it then displays in a table. The `Dashboard` page also makes use of the `auth` middleware to enforce authentication on this page. When a user attempts to hit this page, they will be rerouted to your login page if they are not authenticated.

Add a new file to the `pages` folder and name it `dashboard.vue`. Copy the following code into your `dashboard.vue` file.

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <b-table :items="posts" :fields="fields"> </b-table>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Vue from 'vue'
export default Vue.extend({
  middleware: ['auth'],
  data() {
    return {
      fields: ['userId', 'title', 'body'],
      posts: [],
    }
  },
  async beforeMount() {
    this.$axios
      .$get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
      .then((res) => {
        this.posts = res
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.log(err)
      })
  },
})
</script>
```

Finally you will need to add the login page where Nuxt will route unauthenticated users. Add a new page to the `pages` folder named `login.vue`. Add the following code to it.

```html
<template>
  <div id="page-content" class="p-4">
    <a class="btn btn-primary" @click="$auth.loginWith('okta')">Login with Okta </a>
  </div>
</template>


<script>
export default {
  middleware: ['auth'],
  data() {
    return {}
  },
  beforeMount() {
    if (this.$auth.$state.loggedIn) window.location = '/Dashboard'
  }
}
</script>
```

## Testing your Nuxt application

Now that your application is complete you can run `npm run dev` from your terminal and the application will build. You should see the home page first. 

{% img blog/vue-applications-nuxt/app-home-page.png alt:"The home page of the Nuxt application." width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click on **Dashboard** or **Login** and this should route you to the Okta login form. You can enter your Okta credentials here and you will be routed to the `Dashboard` page where you can view the posts.

## Do more with Nuxt and Vue

With a little bit of code, you can combine Nuxt and Okta to make secure Vue SPAs or universal applications. You can find the source code for the example created in this tutorial [on GitHub](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-vue-nuxt-example).

In this post, you learned how to use the `@nuxt/auth-next` package to secure your Nuxt application using Okta. You also learned how to create the application in Okta and configure the Vue app to use it. Finally, you learned how to use the `@nuxtjs/axios` package to pull data from a sample API.
