There has been a cut-throat competition between cloud hosts in the past few years - each attempting to earn the sympathy of developers and dev-ops by rolling out shiny new tools, plugins, and integrations. There are a gazillion how-to tutorials and guides in the community on using these tools. Sometimes when looking for a solution, it is hard to find the newest and simplest way. I never know if an article written last year is still valid using today's tools. In this article, I'm going to walk you through the deployment of a .NET Core 3.1 application to the major cloud hosts (Microsoft Azure App Service, AWS Beanstalk, Google Cloud App Engine) in the simplest possible way. After deployment, I'll take a few steps forward and configure Okta Authentication in the example application to show how to add a login flow at once.

## How to Secure Your .NET App for Major Cloud Hosts

Okta is a cloud service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or multiple applications. Using Okta you don't have to worry about implementing sign up, login, or logout flows manually.

### Prerequisites

* [Okta Developer account](https://developer.okta.com/)
* [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

Any preferred code editor, I'll be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Mac ðŸ˜±.

*Azure deployment:*

* [Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com)
* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

*AWS deployment:*

*[AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com)

*Google Cloud deployment:*

* [Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com)
* [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk)

## Preparing the .NET Core App for Cloud Host deployment

I have prepared an example application to play around with and see how the deployments work.

Start by cloning the repo to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-netcore3-deploy-to-cloud-hosts-example
```

Since there is Okta Authentication in the example application, you first need to update the related configs.

Log in to your [Okta Developer account](https://login.okta.com)

Navigate to **Applications**, then select **Add Application**.

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image1.png alt:"" width:"500" %}{: .center-image }

Select **Web** as a platform:

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image2.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

On the next screen leave everything as is and select Done.

Scroll down and note your Okta Client Credentials:

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image3.png alt:"" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

Open *appsettings.json* in your favorite code editor and add your credentials.

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image4.png alt:"" width:"500" %}{: .center-image }

You can find your Org URL in the top right corner of the Dashboard:

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image5.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Now your app should be ready for deployment and to run locally. Let's make sure there are no build or runtime errors. Open a terminal or command prompt, go to the project folder and run:

```sh
dotnet run
```

Open your browser at `https://localhost:5001` to see the app running.

>*The Login part of the app doesn't work just now. We will set it up after the deployments.*

## Deploying a .NET Core 3.1 App to Azure App Service

Let's begin by deploying our app to Azure!

### Creating an Azure App Service using Command Line

Open a terminal or command prompt and login to Azure.

```sh
az login
```

A browser window will open asking for your Microsoft Account credentials.

First, we'll have to add a Resource Group:

```sh
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westus
```

Run the following command to set the default resource group and location for all subsequent commands. So we won't have to worry about adding them at each command.

```sh
az configure --defaults group=myResourceGroup location=westus
```

Let's create an App Service plan:

```sh
az appservice plan create --name myPlan --sku F1
```

Finally, create the App Service itself:

Replace <your_app_name> with your preferred name. This will be the URL of your app, like: `http://<your_app_name>.azurewebsites.net`

```sh
az webapp create --name <your_app_name> --plan myPlan --runtime "DOTNETCORE|3.1"
```

Open a browser window at `http://<your_app_name>.azurewebsites.net` and make sure the App Service is running:

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image6.png alt:"" width:"500" %}{: .center-image }

### Deploying the App to Azure App Service using Command Line

It's time to set your deployment credentials. Replace **username** and **password** with your azure credentials.

```sh
az webapp deployment user set --user-name <username> --password <password>
```

Run the following command to retrieve the Git endpoint to which we want to push the app code:

```sh
az webapp deployment source config-local-git --name <your_app_name>
```

Your output should look like this:

```json
{
  "url": "https://gergely.sinka@mydomain.com@<your_app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<your_app_name>.git"
}
```

Now set the output URL **without credentials** as a remote for the local git repository:

```sh
git remote add azure https://<your_app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<your_app_name>.git
```

Finally, push the code to the new remote repository:

```sh
git push azure master
```

Open a browser window at `http://<your_app_name>.azurewebsites.net` to make sure the app is running.

### Configuring Okta for the Azure Hosted App

We need to add our application's URL to Okta to be recognized as a redirect URL.

Going back to the Okta Dashboard **Applications** page, select the App you created in the first section.

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image7.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

In the General tab, click Edit next to the General Settings section:

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image8.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Set the following URLs:

*Login redirect URIs*: `https://<your_app_name>.azurewebsites.net/authorization-code/callback`

*Logout redirect URIs*: `https://<your_app_name>.azurewebsites.net/signout/callback`

Now you should be able to log in and log out in your web application using your Okta credentials.

## Deploying a .NET Core 3.1 App to AWS Beanstalk

Next, we will go through the deployment process for AWS.

### Creating the deployment package

Open a terminal or  command prompt, go to the project folder and run:

```sh
dotnet publish -o my-app
```

Compress the newly created `my-app` folder to a zip archive. This will be our deployment package

### Deploying the package

Visit the AWS [Elastic Beanstalk](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) Console.

Go ahead and *Create Application*:

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image9.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Give it a *Name* and carefully select the Platform as follows:

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image10.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

We'll upload the deployment package by hand. So, set Application Code to *Upload your code*. Now press *Choose file* and upload the previously created .zip file.

Once the upload has finished, hit *Create Application*. You might have to wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete.

### Configuring Okta for the AWS Hosted App

We need to add our application's URL to Okta to be recognized as a redirect URL.

Going back to the Okta Dashboard Applications page. Select the App you created in the first part.

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image11.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

On the General tab hit Edit by the General Settings section:

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image12.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Set the following URLs:
*Login redirect URIs*: `http://<your_app_url>/authorization-code/callback`
e.g.: `http://oktaexample-env.eba-evyiprzp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/authorization-code/callback`

*Logout redirect URIs*: `http://<your_app_url>/signout/callback`
e.g.: `http://oktaexample-env.eba-evyiprzp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/signout/callback`

Now you should be able to log in and log out in your web application using your Okta credentials.

### Troubleshooting

If you run into a Correlation Error after logging in, you'll need to manually set the `SameSite` cookie attribute to `None`, and enable SSL (HTTPS) on your server. I have a detailed article and a guide coming soon on how to set up a Linux server to support Okta login in .NET Core 3.1 applications - be on the lookout for that! To get an idea of the basics, check out my post on how to [Install .NET Core Apps on Linux in 5 Minutes](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/11/25/how-to-install-dotnetcore-on-linux).

## Deploying a .NET Core 3.1 App to Google App Engine

### Preparing Google Cloud App Engine

Open the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create a new Project:

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image13.png alt:"" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

On the welcome screen select *Create Application*.

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image14.png alt:"" width:"500" %}{: .center-image }

Choose any Region. Then add *.NET* as Language and *Flexible* as Environment.

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image15.png alt:"" width:"512" %}{: .center-image }

Open a terminal or  command prompt, go to the project folder and run:

```sh
dotnet publish -o my-app
```

Then go to the newly created folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Log in with the Cloud SDK:

```sh
gcloud init
```

### Deploying the App to Google Cloud Engine

To deploy the application enter:

```sh
gcloud app deploy
```

You might be asked a few questions while the deployment is running.

Once the deployment is finished you can go back to the Cloud Platform Console and click the service to see if the application is running:

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image16.png alt:"" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

### Configuring Okta for the Google Cloud Hosted App

We need to add our application's URL to Okta to be recognized as a redirect URL.

Going back to the Okta Dashboard Applications page, select the App you created in the first part.

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image17.png alt:"" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

On the General tab hit **Edit** by the General Settings section:

{% img blog/dotnetcore-deploy-major-cloud-hosts/image18.png alt:"" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Set the following URLs:
*Login redirect URIs*: `http://<your_app_url>/authorization-code/callback`
e.g.: `http://oktaexample-289720.ew.r.appspot.com/authorization-code/callback`

*Logout redirect URIs*: `http://<your_app_url>/signout/callback`
e.g.: `http://oktaexample-289720.ew.r.appspot.com/signout/callback`

Now you should be able to log in and log out in your web application using your Okta credentials.

## Takeaways

There are quite a few ways to deploy .NET Core applications to major cloud hosts. I have introduced the simplest techniques using basic tools provided. This should be perfect for proof of concept apps and home projects. For simplicity these deployment techniques sometimes need manual steps. If you don't want to repeat them with every deployment, I recommend automating these steps in your CI/CD pipelines. Hopefully I'll have an article coming out in that topic soon!
