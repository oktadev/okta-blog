Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by [Unity Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_Technologies). The engine is able to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering, and construction.

Identity security is a key concept that is mostly missing in Unity. In fact, most engines today do not provide solutions for securing identity, authenticating users, and authorizing users. The industry has instead traditionally relied on custom-built solutions and/or delegated auth from other products, like game stores. As the industry advances beyond anonymous consumption of video games, into massively interconnected online projects, or professional XR use cases such as ArchViz and simulation, new requirements have appeared for authentication and authorization.

In gaming, use cases tend to depend on the project itself. A single-player game really only needs to focus on protecting its own intellectual property from theft. Using a game store's authorization—as is common today—is more than enough for this use case. Even the introduction of microtransactions can stay secure with just a store if these transactions are being handled by that store. However, once the project gets to a point where a user's client needs to authenticate a user and authorize that user to one or multiple servers, the solutions provided by stores fall short. It gets even more complicated when users are actually making purchases or entering personal information into your game client directly. Once the game gets to a more complex level of interconnectivity, and once users are trusting you with private information and financial information, proper identity security is paramount.

With XR use cases, the concept is similar to what is described above for gaming—especially if the project is a VR game—however professional XR projects open up a whole new area of interest. Professional projects such as ArchViz, or simulations done for security or scientific application, need to protect the intellectual property within the project itself, and the user identity, just like games. However, more is potentially needed to handle authorization to specific aspects of the project results, as well as professional requirements to integrate or federate with other technologies used by these professionals.

The level of effort to build identity security from scratch is massive. Just to build a secure store for identity, authentication with basic username/password, authorization via OAuth, and basic security policy, it takes a large team months. When you account for keeping the tech up to date with new standards, compliance with standards such as PCI, compliance with GDPR, complex multi-factor authentication, and complex authorization rules, it becomes apparent that the work is not a one-time effort and it is not easy. Rather than spend countless development cycles focusing on identity security—when the team should be focused on the core project itself—it is much easier and more secure to leave it to the experts. Okta is the most advanced identity platform on the market today and represents the best of breed solution for developers, including Game/XR developers creating within Unity.

## Core Concepts

Before we jump into Unity, it is important to understand what options exist to handle authentication and authorization of users within your project. The most common designs are in engine with native UI, in engine with OAuth via browser, external with native UI, and external with OAuth via browser. The other option, as previously mentioned, is to trust authorization from another product such as a game store.

The decision that needs to be addressed first is the balancing act that every security team must make between what is most secure and what has the best user experience. If the decision is that the project is not storing sensitive user data, then it is reasonable to focus on user experience. However, if there is even a slight risk that a data breach would negatively affect individual consumers, security must take the front seat.

When a project accepts authorization from another product, one that is not a security product like Okta, there is a huge risk with that trust. Risk that users are not being challenged properly with MFA, risk that standards and technology get out of date from what is standard in the security industry, and risk that user data is not being secured and passed correctly and safely. This is the risk represented by delegating security to a game store.

The most secure option would be to leverage OAuth2/OIDC either in the engine or externally in the project's launcher. OAuth2/OIDC is the industry standard best practice for authorization/authentication. OAuth specification defines multiple different flows, or grants, but the most recommended for security is Auth Code with PKCE. You can read more about OAuth2 [here](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-overview/). The complaint typically with OAuth, especially within a game engine directly, is that it traditionally leverages a browser and a hosted login experience. Okta provides a hosted login experience that is fully customizable via HTML/CSS and Unity is able to pop up a browser and receive tokens from it after authentication. How to do this will be described in this blog. What needs to be considered is if that user experience is acceptable for the project. The browser can also be embedded with different Unity browser plugins, found in the asset store, which might make the experience better because the user will not need to leave the game to interact with an external browser. OAuth is considered more secure because users are putting their credentials into a trusted browser and a trusted, secure, login page. Furthermore, the access token that is returned at the end of the authorization process is retrieved by code not running in a browser which means intercepting it is difficult to impossible.

Okta also supports a native UI experience both in engine or externally. This is a better user experience but considered potentially less secure because the project's code is now required to accept a password from a user, properly handle it in a secure way from start to finish, and be secure enough that it can't be exploited by bad actors or rogue software. Essentially you take all of the risk onto yourself to handle the information from the user with care. This concept also requires a bit more work in UI development because the UI will be entirely built in engine and Okta would be interacted with via API only. This option will be reviewed in this blog as well.

In order to help visualize the difference between these concepts, this blog will show you how to build for Native UI and OAuth via browser in engine. These same concepts can also be applied to external solutions, such as a launcher. developer.okta.com contains countless guides and blogs that can assist further with the external use case.

## Create the Project

Get started by creating a new project in Unity Hub. Select **3D** and give the project a name.


{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/1-unity-start.png alt:"Start Unity Project" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Unity will take a moment to set everything up and open the project. Once open, click **Assets** > **Import Package** and select the `OktaSDK.unitypackage` file. The Okta Auth SDK will be used for the Native UI design. The SDK is not required for OAuth. A [Okta SDK Unity Package](https://okta.box.com/s/m5q2ucervn03cbzu5dpgzx2vxmeg3xph) has been provided with this guide to simplify this process.

> Note: The [Okta SDK for .NET](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-dotnet) and the [Okta Auth SDK for .NET](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-dotnet) can be found on GitHub and NuGet. However, Unity does not work well with NuGet and compiling from source should not be necessary. If manual installation is desired, there are numerous dependencies that NuGet would normally add to a project with the SDK. These dependencies will need to be manually downloaded and added to Unity. [NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/) is recommended for this.


{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/2-unity-import.png alt:"Unity import package" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Make sure all libraries are selected and click **Import**. This will create a Plugins folder inside the Assets folder which is how Unity knows to import the .NET libraries as [managed plugins](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingDLL.html).

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/3-unity-plugins.png alt:"Unity import package" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Next, click on the **Asset Store** tab in the editor and search for `Unity Samples: UI.` This example asset was created by Unity Technologies as a learning asset, teaching best practices for building UI's inside of Unity. For this guide, we will leverage this UI to build our login experience.

Click **Import** and import all of the assets in the package.


{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/4-unity-samplesui.png alt:"Unity import package" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Once the import process is complete, click on the **Scenes** folder and open the `Menu 3D` scene. Click **Play** to run the project and make sure that the UI is properly functioning.

Save 2 copies of this scene, one for `Native`, and one for `OAuth`.

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/5-unity-scenes.png alt:"Unity import package" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

## Native: Build the Auth Menu

Open the example scene saved for the Native experience.

The UI sample asset does not come with any type of input field. We will need input fields for a `Username` box and a `Password` box. To create a new Input Field object:

1. Open the `Prefabs` folder
2. Duplicate the **SF Button** object (Ctrl + D)
3. Rename the duplicate object **SF InputField**
4. Delete the label element out of the object
5. Click the **GameObject** menu > **UI** > **InputField**
6. Position the new InputField where the label element was
7. Switch the gizmo to scale and resize the InputField to fill out the box


{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/6-unity-username.png alt:"Unity import package" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Next, a new menu will be needed for the Auth Menu. The simplest way to create this is to duplicate the existing `MainMenu` object and customize it. To create the Auth Menu:

1. Select `MainMenu` and duplicate it (Ctrl + D).
2. With `MainMenu` still selected, click the checkbox in the inspector to disable it. This will make the `MainMenu` object disappear.
3. Rename the duplicated menu to `AuthMenu`.
4. Delete the `Continue` and `New Game` objects
5. Rename the `Settings` object to `Next`
6. Drag in 2 of the InputField prefabs and rename them to `Username` and `Password` respectively.
7. Expand the `Password` object and click on the InputField object. In the Inspector, scroll down to Content Type and change to Password.
8. Change `Username's` position PosY to 70, and change `Password's` PosY to 0.
9. Expand the `Username` object, expand the InputField, select Placeholder, and change the text to `Username`. Do this for the `Password` object next.
10. With `AuthMenu` still selected, click the checkbox in the inspector to disable it. This will make the `AuthMenu` disappear.

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/7-unity-authwindow.png alt:"Unity import package" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Click `MenuManager` and make sure it is enabled in the inspector. Find the `PanelManager` script component attached to the `MenuManager` object and double click to edit. This will open up the primary IDE configured in Unity.

## Native: Authenticate with Okta

Reference the `Okta Auth SDK` by adding the following to the end of the using statements.

```csharp
using Okta.Auth.Sdk;
using Okta.Sdk.Abstractions.Configuration;
```

The login code will need to understand some of the elements in the menu to be able to interact with them. Expose public variables so that these elements can be configured in the editor. After the initiallyOpen Animator on line 11, add:

```csharp
public Animator authMenu;
public static bool isAuthenticated;

public InputField Username;
public InputField Password;
public string OktaDomain;
```

`authMenu` will hold the `AuthMenu` object that was created earlier. `IsAuthenticated` will allow the UI to determine what to display. The two InputFields will hold the `Username` and `Password` InputField objects that were added to the Auth Menu. The `OktaDomain` string will hold the `Okta Developer Org URL`.

At line 38, inside the `OpenPanel` method, add:

```csharp
if (!isAuthenticated)
{
   anim = authMenu;
}
```

In `OpenPanel`, anim is the variable holding what UI panel to open. If authentication is required or has not been completed, we always want to override whatever panel is in the process of opening and open the Auth Menu instead. This forces the user to log in when needed.

Next, create the `Login()` function that the `Next` button will call on click. At line 86 add:

```csharp
public async void Login()
{
   var client = new AuthenticationClient(new OktaClientConfiguration
   {
      OktaDomain = OktaDomain,
   });

   var authnOptions = new AuthenticateOptions()
   {
      Username = Username.text.ToString(),
      Password = Password.text.ToString(),
   };

   try
   {
      var authnResponse = await client.AuthenticateAsync(authnOptions);

      Debug.Log("Authentication Status: " + authnResponse.AuthenticationStatus);
      if (authnResponse.AuthenticationStatus == "SUCCESS")
      {
         //Store the token
         Debug.Log(authnResponse.SessionToken);
         isAuthenticated = true;

         OpenPanel(initiallyOpen);
      }
      else
      {
         //Handle Errors
         Debug.Log("Authentication Failed...");
      }
   }
   catch (System.Exception ex)
    {
      Debug.Log(ex.Message);
     }
 }
```

Save `PanelManager.cs` and switch back to Unity.

Make sure `MenuManager` is selected and notice the new properties in the `PanelManager` component attached to the `MenuManager` object. To configure the PanelManager, do the following:

1. Drag the `AuthMenu` object from the project hierarchy to the `authMenu` property in the inspector.
2. Drag the InputField from the `Username` object in the project hierarchy to the `Username` property in the inspector.
3. Drag the InputField from the `Password` object in the project hierarchy to the `Password` property in the inspector.
4. Enter the Okta domain from the Okta developer org "{yourOktaDomain}".


{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/8-unity-panelmanager.png alt:"Unity import package" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Now, wire the `Next` button's OnClick event to the `Login()` method in `PanelManager.cs`. Click the `Next` button object in the hierarchy window, find the **On Click ()** section in the inspector windows and change the dropdown to **PanelManager** > **Login()**.

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/9-unity-panelmanager-login.png alt:"Unity import package" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Click **Play** to run the project and log in using user credentials for a user in the associated Okta Developer Org.

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/10-unity-runproject.png alt:"Unity import package" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

If Authentication was successful, a session token will appear along with the `SUCCESS` result coming from the [Okta AuthN API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/).

Now that the client is able to authenticate users via basic auth, more advanced concepts can be added such as support for MFA and user account/profile management. This is done by adding logic to the code described in this guide that handles other authentication states within the Okta [AuthN](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/) API. The SDK is already able to handle these concepts which means that the additional code is needed only for the UI in Unity. This code is outside the scope of this blog but the [AuthN](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/) API leveraged for this experience is documented on developer.okta.com

## OAuth: Authenticate with Okta

Open the scene that was saved for the `OAuth` experience.

To protect the scene with OAuth, a simple GameObject is all that is needed. Create one by clicking **GameObject** and then **Create New**. Name this GameObject `OktaOAuth2`.

If `Assets` > `Scripts` does not exist in the project, create a folder called `Assets` and a folder inside Assets called `Scripts`. Create a new cs script within the `Scripts` folder and name this script `OktaOAuth2.cs`. This script will be added to the GameObject and will force unauthorized users to authorize before interacting with the scene.

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/11-unity-attachscript.png alt:"Unity import package" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Edit `OktaOAuth2.cs`.

This example makes use of multiple libraries, all of which are included with .Net with the exception of Newtonsoft.Json. Start by adding the following references:

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.IO;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Sockets;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
```

Newtonsoft.Json is already included with the Okta SDK unity package. If this is already imported into the project, and a Plugins folder already exists with a Newtonsoft.Json.dll file inside, skip the next steps describing the manual installation of Newtonsoft.Json.

Next, go back to Unity and create a folder inside `Assets` called `Plugins`.

The easiest way to add Newtonsoft.Json to the Unity project is to manually download it and add it to the project. This is because Unity does not support Nuget directly.

Go to `nuget.org` and search `Newtonsoft`. [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) Download the package and open it as a zip file. Open *lib* > *net20* and extract Newtonsoft.Json.dll to the `Plugins` folder in the Unity project.

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/12-unity-newtonsoft.png alt:"Unity import package" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Go back to editing `OktaOAuth2.cs`.

Within the default class generated by Unity, create public variables to hold our Okta configuration information.

```csharp
// client configuration
public string clientID;
public string clientSecret;
public string authorizationEndpoint;
public string tokenEndpoint;
public string userInfoEndpoint;
```

In the `Start()` method, call `doOAuth()`, which is where we will process the OAuth logic.

```csharp
// Start is called before the first frame update
void Start()
{
   // Add logic to check current auth state and only doOAuth() when needed.
   doOAuth();
}
```

`doOAuth()` will need to handle popping up a browser, redirecting the user for authentication, and receiving/validating access tokens upon return. How to design code in .Net for OAuth2 is a large topic and outside the scope of this blog. You can read more about OAuth2 [here](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-overview/) on developer.okta.com. For this example, I am providing code that I am using in my own project to help explain the concept.

```csharp
private async void doOAuth()
{
    // Generates state and PKCE values.
    string state = randomDataBase64url(32);
    string code_verifier = randomDataBase64url(32);
    string code_challenge = base64urlencodeNoPadding(sha256(code_verifier));
    const string code_challenge_method = "S256";
    // Creates a redirect URI using an available port on the loopback address.
    string redirectURI = string.Format("http://{0}:{1}/", IPAddress.Loopback, /*GetRandomUnusedPort()*/51772);
    output("redirect URI: " + redirectURI);
    // Creates an HttpListener to listen for requests on that redirect URI.
    var http = new HttpListener();
    http.Prefixes.Add(redirectURI);
    output("Listening..");
    http.Start();
    // Creates the OAuth 2.0 authorization request.
    string authorizationRequest = string.Format("{0}?response_type=code&scope=openid%20profile&redirect_uri={1}&client_id={2}&state={3}&code_challenge={4}&code_challenge_method={5}",
        authorizationEndpoint,
        System.Uri.EscapeDataString(redirectURI),
        clientID,
        state,
        code_challenge,
        code_challenge_method);
    // Opens request in the browser.
    System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(authorizationRequest);
    // Waits for the OAuth authorization response.
    var context = await http.GetContextAsync();
    // Sends an HTTP response to the browser.
    var response = context.Response;
    string responseString = string.Format("<html><head><meta http-equiv='refresh' content='10;url=https://developer.okta.com'></head><body>Please return to the app.</body></html>");
    var buffer = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(responseString);
    response.ContentLength64 = buffer.Length;
    var responseOutput = response.OutputStream;
    Task responseTask = responseOutput.WriteAsync(buffer, 0, buffer.Length).ContinueWith((task) =>
    {
        responseOutput.Close();
        http.Stop();
        Console.WriteLine("HTTP server stopped.");
    });
    // Checks for errors.
    if (context.Request.QueryString.Get("error") != null)
    {
        output(String.Format("OAuth authorization error: {0}.", context.Request.QueryString.Get("error")));
        return;
    }
    if (context.Request.QueryString.Get("code") == null
        || context.Request.QueryString.Get("state") == null)
    {
        output("Malformed authorization response. " + context.Request.QueryString);
        return;
    }
    // extracts the code
    var code = context.Request.QueryString.Get("code");
    var incoming_state = context.Request.QueryString.Get("state");
    // Compares the receieved state to the expected value, to ensure that
    // this app made the request which resulted in authorization.
    if (incoming_state != state)
    {
        output(String.Format("Received request with invalid state ({0})", incoming_state));
        return;
    }
    output("Authorization code: " + code);
    // Starts the code exchange at the Token Endpoint.
    performCodeExchange(code, code_verifier, redirectURI);
}
async void performCodeExchange(string code, string code_verifier, string redirectURI)
{
    output("Exchanging code for tokens...");
    // builds the  request
    string tokenRequestBody = string.Format("code={0}&redirect_uri={1}&client_id={2}&code_verifier={3}&client_secret={4}&scope=&grant_type=authorization_code",
        code,
        System.Uri.EscapeDataString(redirectURI),
        clientID,
        code_verifier,
        clientSecret
        );
    // sends the request
    HttpWebRequest tokenRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(tokenEndpoint);
    tokenRequest.Method = "POST";
    tokenRequest.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
    //tokenRequest.Accept = "Accept=application/json;charset=UTF-8";
    byte[] _byteVersion = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(tokenRequestBody);
    tokenRequest.ContentLength = _byteVersion.Length;
    Stream stream = tokenRequest.GetRequestStream();
    await stream.WriteAsync(_byteVersion, 0, _byteVersion.Length);
    stream.Close();
    try
    {
        // gets the response
        WebResponse tokenResponse = await tokenRequest.GetResponseAsync();
        using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(tokenResponse.GetResponseStream()))
        {
            // reads response body
            string responseText = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
            Console.WriteLine(responseText);
            // converts to dictionary
            Dictionary<string, string> tokenEndpointDecoded = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Dictionary<string, string>>(responseText);
            string access_token = tokenEndpointDecoded["access_token"];
            Debug.Log(access_token);
            userinfoCall(access_token);
        }
    }
    catch (WebException ex)
    {
        if (ex.Status == WebExceptionStatus.ProtocolError)
        {
            var response = ex.Response as HttpWebResponse;
            if (response != null)
            {
                output("HTTP: " + response.StatusCode);
                using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream()))
                {
                    // reads response body
                    string responseText = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
                    output(responseText);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

While the OAuth2 code can vary, so long as it follows spec, the part that is relevant for Unity is how to get the browser to appear and redirect the user to login.

```csharp
// Opens request in the browser.
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(authorizationRequest);
```

Passing a URL to `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start()` in Unity will launch a browser that can be used to log a user in. This part could be replaced with an [embedded browser](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/embedded-browser-55459) solution from the asset store to improve the user experience by keeping the user in the engine. However, the interaction with Okta would be the same.

The OAuth2 code provided does rely on a few helper methods around base64 encoding, cryptology, and logging.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Appends the given string to the on-screen log, and the debug console.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="output">string to be appended</param>
public void output(string output)
{
   Debug.Log(output);
}

/// <summary>
/// Returns URI-safe data with a given input length.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="length">Input length (nb. output will be longer)</param>
/// <returns></returns>
public static string randomDataBase64url(uint length)
{
   RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
    byte[] bytes = new byte[length];
   rng.GetBytes(bytes);
   return base64urlencodeNoPadding(bytes);
}

/// <summary>
/// Returns the SHA256 hash of the input string.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="inputString"></param>
/// <returns></returns>
public static byte[] sha256(string inputString)
{
   byte[] bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(inputString);
   SHA256Managed sha256 = new SHA256Managed();
   return sha256.ComputeHash(bytes);
}

/// <summary>
/// Base64url no-padding encodes the given input buffer.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="buffer"></param>
/// <returns></returns>
public static string base64urlencodeNoPadding(byte[] buffer)
{
   string base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(buffer);

   // Converts base64 to base64url.
   base64 = base64.Replace("+", "-");
   base64 = base64.Replace("/", "_");
   // Strips padding.
   base64 = base64.Replace("=", "");

    return base64;
}
```

The most important logic still needed is calling out to UserInfo. UserInfo is an Open ID Connect defined endpoint that returns data on a user in exchange for a valid access token. Okta has the ability to add new data as claims to the access token itself so this may not be required, but if the goal is to keep the access token as light as possible, this type of introspection might be desired.

```csharp
async void userinfoCall(string access_token)
{
   output("Making API Call to Userinfo...");

   // sends the request
   HttpWebRequest userinfoRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(userInfoEndpoint);
   userinfoRequest.Method = "GET";
   userinfoRequest.Headers.Add(string.Format("Authorization: Bearer {0}", access_token));
   userinfoRequest.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
   //userinfoRequest.Accept = "Accept=text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8";

   // gets the response
   WebResponse userinfoResponse = await userinfoRequest.GetResponseAsync();
   using (StreamReader userinfoResponseReader = new StreamReader(userinfoResponse.GetResponseStream()))
   {
      // reads response body
      string userinfoResponseText = await userinfoResponseReader.ReadToEndAsync();
      output(userinfoResponseText);
   }
}
```

Save the script and go back to Unity.

Click the `OktaOAuth2` GameObject and notice the public variables from the `OktaOAuth2.cs` script in the inspector.

Next, go to an Okta tenant, or create a new dev tenant at `developer.okta.com`, and log in.

Click on **Applications** > **Add Application** and choose **Web**.

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/15-okta-webapp.png alt:"Okta add web app" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

This application is the representation of your OAuth2 client within Okta. Give the application a name and trust the local IP/Port that your client will be using to interact with Okta. By default, the sample code is set to `http://127.0.0.1:51772` where the IP is the client's local IP address.

Click **Done**.

The next menu will be the General tab for the application's settings menu. At the bottom of General, there is a section containing a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. Copy these and paste them into the inspector for the `OktaOAuth2` GameObject in Unity.

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/18-unity-clientidsecret.png alt:"Okta add web app" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

For the three endpoint URL's, go back to Okta. In the top menu click **API** > **Authorization Servers**.

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/19-okta-authserver.png alt:"Okta add web app" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Click **default** to open the default authorization server. Click the **Metadata URI** link.

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/20-okta-defaultserver.png alt:"Okta add web app" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Find the `authorization endpoint`, `token endpoint`, and `userinfo endpoint` urls, copy and paste into the `OktaOAuth2` GameObject inspector in Unity.

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/21-unity-gameinspector.png alt:"Okta add web app" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

{% img blog/unity-csharp-security/22-unity-inspector2.png alt:"Okta add web app" width:"1000" %}{: .center-image }

Fully log out of Okta and close the browser if possible before testing. Make sure the project is saved and run it. When the browser appears, log in. Close the browser when prompted and return to Unity. The console will contain tokens and claims for the user.

The great thing about authenticating via OAuth2 and Okta's hosted login widget is that the level of effort to build out the UI to support complex concepts like MFA is no longer required. Okta handles every aspect of authentication freeing up developers to focus on the project itself. Best of all, this hosted login experience can be fully customized. Everything from the domain of the page to its HTML and CSS is exposed within Okta so that users stay within your branded echo system.

To further enhance the example, code could be added to check a user's authentication state on start of every scene or before secure actions are allowed. This is easily done by calling the `userinfoCall()` method from the example code. Simply save the access token on the user's first login to a secure location, such as a vault, and check if there is a token on `Start()`. If a token exists, send it to the `userinfoCall()` method from the sample code and act on the results. If there is no token, or if the existing token is not valid, call `doOAuth()`.

## Conclusion

Identity security is a very complex, but increasingly required, aspect of most game/XR projects today. The resource commitment required to build out all of the functionality needed, and then maintain and grow that functionality, is massive. When it's done incorrectly it can be devastating. Leaving identity security to the experts and leveraging the best of breed Okta Identity Platform for all identity security needs in your project will save countless hours and ensure that intellectual property and customer accounts are properly secured.

To expand on the ideas discussed in this blog, I recommend further reading on securely storing access tokens using vaults, such as [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), and authorizing users to Network Engines such as [Photon](https://www.photonengine.com/pun). Stay tuned to developer.okta.com/blog for further discussions on these topics and more.
