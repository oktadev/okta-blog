Node.js just celebrated its 11th birthday on May 27! With the state of things nows, it's pretty crazy to think back to the massive JavaScript Renaissance boost of 2009. In case you're not aware, the JavaScript Renaissance began in around 2004 with Ajax, increased exponentially with jQuery in the mid-2000s, and then really took off with Node.js and a plethora of early JavaScript web frameworks; including Backbone.js, Ember.js, and AngularJS.

Today, I'd like to show you the power of Node.js with a simple login example. Express.js is one of the oldest and most-used server-side MVC frameworks for Node.js. Okta happens to provide an https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/tree/master/packages/oidc-middleware#readme[OIDC Middleware package] that integrates with Express to secure your app with login and logout functionality.

To show how it all works, I created a screencast: https://youtu.be/BgpsNi_6mzg[Node.js Login with Express and OIDC].

== Create an Express App and Add Login in 5 Steps

**Step 1**: Create a new project with https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html[express-generator] and pug for the view.

[source,shell]
----
mkdir express-app
cd express-app
npx express-generator --view=pug
----

**Step 2**: {% include setup/cli.md type="web" list="true" loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000/callback" logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000" %}

**Step 3**: Install Schematics CLI:

[source,shell]
----
npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
----

**Step 4**: Install and run OktaDev Schematics with your Okta values for `$issuer`, `$clientId`, and `$clientSecret`:

[source,shell]
----
npm i -D @oktadev/schematics
schematics @oktadev/schematics:add-auth --issuer=$issuer --clientId=$clientId --clientSecret=$clientSecret
----

CAUTION: An `.env` file will be generated with your client secret in it. Make sure to add `*.env` to `.gitignore` and don't check it into source control!

**Step 5**: Start your app and authenticate with Okta! ðŸš€

[source,shell]
----
npm start
----
