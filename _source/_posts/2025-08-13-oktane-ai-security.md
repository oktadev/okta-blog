AI is taking over the world by storm! This year, AI is our focus at Oktane. We want to ensure you have the tools, the know-how, and solutions to keep your software systems secure, from traditional user apps to AI agents. 

We can't wait to meet you and hear about your application needs and challenges. Join us at Caesars Forum in Las Vegas, NV, on September 24-26, 2025, for [Oktane](https://www.okta.com/oktane), and let's nerd out on security, AI, and identity. Throw in a dash of fun for good measure!

We planned fantastic events to help you navigate this world with AI and identity challenges. Find us and let's chat at these activities: 

# Stop by the Oktane Developer Lounge

Find our lounge in the Oktane Expo Hall, where you'll discover the ways Okta can help you create secure applications with human and non-human identities. ðŸ¤–

Learn more about securing AI with Cross App Access, and hear lightning talks about on-point security and identity topics!

You'll also have a chance to connect with identity experts from our friends on the Developer Support teams. Do you have a question about your Okta implementation? The Developer Support team is here to help!

We want your feedback on our documentation! Visit our booth's interactive games and tell us how you learn about identity concepts. Your input will help us organize and present our docs in a clearer, more intuitive way. 

We'll also have more going on in the Developer Lounge. You won't want to miss out on the action.

## Check out the Oktane hands-on labs for interactive learning opportunities

Roll up your sleeves and get your coding on. This is your chance to build code using Okta solutions and network with like-minded developers. [Sign up for admin and developer labs](https://www.okta.com/oktane/labs/) and save your spot for great hands-on experiences such as:

**Secure Your Enterprise AI with the new OAuth Extension Protocol Cross-App Access (CAA) and Model Context Protocol (MCP)** <br/>
Secure AI access to enterprise applications using the new OAuth Cross-App Access (CAA) extension and Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Terraform 101: Automating Okta** <br/>
Learn the basics of Terraform and get hands-on using it to manage an Okta tenant

**Use Okta Identity Governance to Replace Standing Admin Access with Time-Bound Requests** <br/>
Get more out of Okta Identity Governance and reduce your attack surface by leveraging Workflows to enhance streamlining least privilege access for administrative permissions

**Use Possession-proof Tokens to Protect Your Apps with Okta** <br/>
Leverage the OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) spec to add an extra protection mechanism on access tokens. This lab upgrades a Single Page Application (SPA) â€“ using an OAuth 2.0 Bearer access token â€“ into a more secure DPoP token.
