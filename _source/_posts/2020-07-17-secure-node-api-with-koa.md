Koa is a web framework from the makers of Express. Koa is designed to be middleware-driven and extremely lightweight. It is so lightweight that it comes without any middleware on its own. But not to fear, there are plenty of packages available for basic functionality such as routing, authentication, body parsing, and more. You can also write your own custom middleware— I'll show you how in this tutorial. Koa prides itself on using async functions allowing developers to move away from callbacks.

In this application, you will continue with the [Garduino project you started earlier](/blog/2020/07/10/quickly-build-apps-with-sailsjs). In that tutorial, we created a web application that would display various statistics about a home garden, and let you turn a water fountain on or off remotely. This was accomplished with an Arduino board connected to a series of sensors and a GSM module in the garden. The board would be able to call a REST API to post the data from the garden and check for any fountain requests. It would also be able to respond to those requests to let the web application know it was completed.

In this project, you will work on the REST API portion of the project. To ensure incoming requests to the API are authorized, you will leverage [Okta](https://developer.okta.com) to issue a JSON Web Token (JWT) which will then be validated in your API. You'll see how easy it is to use Okta to set up an authorization server and request a secure JWT from that server. You will also leverage the Okta JWT Verifier to make the authorization process as easy as possible.

It will be the responsibility of the Arduino to obtain or refresh a web token before making a request. For this project, you will use Postman or Advanced Rest Client to make your requests to the API.

## Create Your Authentication Server

One of the best things about using Okta is that you can use it as an authentication server to issue JWT tokens to your users. In this case, you will be authenticating the application itself rather than individual users. To do so, you'll need to set up a new application. Head to your Okta developer console and click on **Applications**. Next, click **Add Application**. On the next page select **Service** as your application type. Give your application a meaningful name. I named my _GarduinoAPI_. This will bring you to your application home page. Take note of your _client Id_ and _client secret_ as you will need these for testing your application.

Next click on **API** in the header bar then **Authorization Servers**. By default, Okta will add one for you—it's fine to use for development purposes. In production, you will want to add a new one. Click on **default** to open the authorization server. Click on **Scopes** and **Add Scope**. Name this scope _API_, you will need this when testing your application. Under settings, note your _Issuer_ URL, this is the base of your endpoint for requesting tokens. Finally, you can test your settings by going to **Token Preview**. Change _Grant type_ to _Client Credentials_, _OAuth/OIDC client_ to _GarduinoAPI_, and _Scopes_ to API. Then click **Preview Token**. You should see some sample data appear in the preview window with the JWT redacted.

Once you see the successful preview, your authorization server is ready for use.

## Create the Koa API

With your authorization server set up, it's time to create your API. Create a new folder and run the command `npm init`. This will walk you through the stages of naming your application and setting up basic configuration details. With that done, it's time to start installing the packages you'll need for this application.

First, you will want to get Koa and any related middleware that will be helpful for the project.

```sh
npm i koa@2.9.0
npm i koa-bodyparser@4.3.0
npm i @koa/router@8.0.8
```

Since Koa doesn't come with any built-in middleware, you need to install a couple of essentials, notably a router and a body-parser.

Next, install the Okta JWT Verifier.

```sh
npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@1.0.0
```

This package will make verifying the token from your authorization server as simple as can be. And that's it. Koa prides itself on being very lightweight—So far, so good. Of course, you will add more packages as you build more complex applications and take them to production.

Finally, you will need dotenv for access to sensitive data from your `.env` file.

```sh
npm i dotenv
```

At this point, you can add your `.env` file to the root and add the following entries.

```sh
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourOktaClientID}
OKTA_ISSUER={yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
OKTA_AUDIENCE=api://default
```

The `OKTA_ISSUER` and `OKTA_AUDIENCE` assume you are using the default authorization server. If you are using a different server you will need to amend that to match.

## Custom KOA Middleware

You will write three pieces of custom middleware. The first is a wrapper for the Okta JWT Verifier. You'll see how that works shortly, but essentially you are just adding more robust error handling to the built-in functionality. The second is a data validation piece that will ensure the required data exists before allowing it to post. The third is a repository layer that will handle the data access.

### JWT Verifier

Create a new file called `jwtverifier.js` in your root and add the following code:

```javascript
const OktaJwtVerifier = require('@okta/jwt-verifier')

const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  issuer: process.env.OKTA_ISSUER,
  clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID
})

module.exports = async (ctx, next) => {

  const { authorization } = ctx.headers;

  if (!authorization) {
    ctx.throw(401);
  }

  const [authType, token] = authorization.trim().split(' ');

  try {
    const { claims } = await oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(token, process.env.OKTA_AUDIENCE)

    if (!claims) {
      ctx.throw(401);
    }
    if (!claims.scp.includes('api')) {
      ctx.throw(401);
    }
  }
  catch (err) {
    ctx.throw(401);
  }

  next();
}
```

There's a little bit of magic happening in this simple code. Of course, you're verifying that an authorization header was sent, and then passing it into the JWT verifier to check its status. That much is pretty simple. The trick though, is the function signature that Koa expects, `(ctx, next)`. Specifically `ctx`, which will hold all the information about your request and response models. Using `ctx`, you can return status codes, throw errors, access the headers, read the body, or anything else you would expect from the request or response.

The Okta JWT Verifier used here is very simple. It will throw an error if the token is invalid, hence the `try/catch`. Otherwise, it will accept the token and provide you with the claims. You can check the claims to ensure the application scope includes the `api` scope you added during your authorization phase.

### Data Validation

Next is a short data validation class. Add a new folder called `dataValidation` and inside that folder, add a file called `dataval.js`. Place the following code there.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  fountainRequest: async (ctx, next) => {
    const { fountainRequest } = ctx.request.body;

    if (!fountainRequest) {
      ctx.throw(400);
    }

    if (!fountainRequest.id) {
      ctx.throw(400);
    }

    next();
  },

  gardenData: async (ctx, next) => {
    const { gardenData } = ctx.request.body;

    if (!gardenData) {
      ctx.throw(400);
    }

    next();
  },
};
```

Here you have two functions, each validating a different model. When the Arduino requests to update a fountain request, it needs to ensure the request model is populated and the id of that model is populated. With the post to save garden data, you are just checking to ensure the garden object is included in the request. If these fail, you return an error 400, `Bad Request`.

### Data Access

Next is the data access. This work is stubbed out, and it's left to you to integrate into your database of choice using your ORM of choice. But you can see how this works. Add a new folder called `data` and add two files, `fountainRequest.repo.js` and `gardenData.repo.js`.

Add the following code to `gardenData.repo.js`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  save: async (ctx, next) => {
    const { gardenData } = ctx.request.body;
    next();
  },
};
```

Next, add the code for `fountainRequest.repo.js`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  get: async (ctx, next) => {
    ctx.body = {
      requestId: 15,
      respondedTo: true,
      toggle: false,
      createdDate: 1588953915653,
    };

    next();
  },

  save: async (ctx, next) => {
    next();
  },
};
```

As you can see you are just sending some sample data back to the client. When saving data, if the model was validated and correct, you can allow the application to proceed to the next function.

Note that you are passing the data back using the `ctx`. In this case, `ctx.body` is what will be returned to the client. Another useful property is `ctx.state` which is the preferred way to pass data between middlewares without exposing it back to the client.

## Add the Node.js Middleware to the Koa API

The last thing left is to tie it all together. You will do that in your `index.js` file. If you don't have one, add it to your root.

```javascript
require("dotenv").config();
const Koa = require("koa");
const router = require("@koa/router")();
const app = new Koa();
const bodyParser = require("koa-bodyparser");
const jwtVerifier = require("./jwtVerifier");

const fountainRequestRepo = require("./data/fountainRequest.repo");
const gardenDataRepo = require("./data/gardenData.repo");

const dataval = require("./dataValidation/dataval");

app.use(bodyParser());

router.use(["/gardenData", "/fountainRequest"], jwtVerifier);

router.get("/echo", (ctx, next) => {
  ctx.body = ctx.request.query.message;
});

router.post(
  "/gardenData",
  dataval.gardenData,
  gardenDataRepo.save,
  (ctx, next) => {
    ctx.status = 200;
    next();
  }
);

router.get("/fountainRequest", fountainRequestRepo.get, (ctx, next) => {
  ctx.status = 200;
  next();
});

router.post(
  "/fountainRequest",
  dataval.fountainRequest,
  fountainRequestRepo.save,
  (ctx, next) => {
    ctx.status = 200;
    next();
  }
);

app.use(router.routes());
app.listen(3000);
```

At the top, you will see the requisite `require` statements for importing the various packages you will need. Then you are telling Koa to use the `koa-bodyparser` package.

Then you define which routes should use the `jwtVerifier` middleware you wrote earlier. Because the `jwtVerifier` is acting as your authorization by telling the router to use it on the `/gardenData` and `/fountainRequest` paths, you are essentially telling Koa that those are under authentication and/or authorization. There are several authentication and authorization middleware packages available depending on how you plan on authenticating users in other applications. But given that you are using Okta here, the custom `jwtVerifier` is perfect.

Next, you are defining the routes the application will have. The `GET /echo` route is for testing the application once it's up and running.

Since the Arduino does not need historical data, there is no need to implement a `get` on the `POST /gardenData` path. Taking a closer look at this route, you see how all the middleware comes together. First, you define the path, then you pass in middleware functions that are executed. The data is validated, saved, and finally, an inline function returns a status code `200` to the client. Of course, the last function doesn't need to be defined here, you could have defined it in its own module and pass it in the `save()` as `dataval.gardenData` or `gardenDataRepo.save`.

The `GET /fountainRequest` route gets the latest `fountainRequest`. As you saw earlier, the fountain repo will attach the object to the `ctx.body` so there is no need to reattach it. The final function sets the status to 200.

Finally, the `POST fountainRequest` route validates the data, then passes it to the repo for processing against your database.

Once your routes are defined, you can register them with `app.use(router.routes())`. Then kick off your server with `app.listen(3000)` to start listening on port 3000.

## Testing your Node.js Koa API

Your application is now built and ready for use. You can start it up with the `node index.js` command from the terminal. Once the application is started, you can use your favorite API client to test the `GET echo` route. For this task, I like to use Advanced REST Client. Postman is another great option. Try requesting `http://localhost:3000/echo?message=this+is+a+test`. You won't need an authorization header for this call.

{% img blog/secure-node-api-with-koa/image5.png alt:"Test API" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, you can test the `GET /fountainRequest` method. First, try it with no authorization header. The API returns a 401 emanating from the custom token verification middleware you wrote.

{% img blog/secure-node-api-with-koa/image2.png alt:"401 unauthorized" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

To get a token, `POST` a request to your authorization's token endpoint, `https://{yourOktaOrgUrl}/oauth2/default/v1/token`. To do this you will need to set the `Content-Type` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and include the following parameters: `grant_type` = `client_credentials`, `scope`= `api`, `client_id` = `{yourOktaClientId}`, `client_secret`=`{yourOktaClientSecret}`. Sending this request should return a JWT with some additional information about the token.

{% img blog/secure-node-api-with-koa/image3.png alt:"Get a token" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Copy the `access_token` value. Use that token in the `fountainRequest` by setting the `Authorization` header value to `Bearer {yourToken}`.

{% img blog/secure-node-api-with-koa/image4.png alt:"Authorized request" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

You can repeat the above steps for your `fountainRequest/post` and `gardenData/post` methods as well to ensure your authentication mechanism is working. Each time your client makes a call to your API, you need to make sure it sends a valid JWT in the header.

## Learn More About Node.js and Okta

In this tutorial, you learned how to build an API with Koa, how to use Okta as an authorization server, and how to request a JWT token from Okta and verify it in your Koa API. I hope you liked seeing the power and speed of combining Okta's Authentication model with the slick Koa framework.
