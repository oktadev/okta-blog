Authenticating users for Node.js/Express.js web apps can be difficult. You have to set up a database, define a user schema (or use something more flexible like NoSQL), write code to handle password hashing, etc. It's annoying.

Using Okta's API service, however, you can easily register and log in users to your Node website using our OpenID Connect integration.

## Set Up Your Node Environment

If you're new to Node and don't already have it installed, you'll need to do that first. To keep things simple, let's assume a \*nix-based environment (e.g. Mac, \*nix, or [Linux on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)).

There's a great tool called `nvm`, which makes it very simple to install various versions of Node and switch on the fly if you need to test with another version. It will also make sure you have the latest version of node installed and ready to go. Run the following command to install Node via `nvm` and get your environment fully set up.

```console
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.9/install.sh | bash
```

If you run into trouble installing, you can find more information on the [installation section of the `nvm` README](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation).

## Create a Simple Node Application

Now that you have Node installed, let's get started writing an app.

**NOTE**: If you want to skip the tutorial and jump straight to the finished product you can [check out this sample app on GitHub](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-node-express-example).

In the Node ecosystem, the most popular web server is [Express](https://expressjs.com/). Luckily for you, the Express team has also created a nifty [command line tool](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) which helps bootstrap Express web applications. You can always customize the bootstrapped project `express-generator` generates, but let's start with that to get up and running quickly.

```bash
$ npm i -g express-generator@4.16.0
/Users/bmk/.nvm/versions/node/v9.5.0/bin/express -> /Users/bmk/.nvm/versions/node/v9.5.0/lib/node_modules/express-generator/bin/expr
ess-cli.js
+ express-generator@4.16.0

$ express -v hbs --git simple-node-authentication

   create : simple-node-authentication/views/index.hbs
   create : simple-node-authentication/views/layout.hbs

   create : simple-node-authentication/app.js
   create : simple-node-authentication/package.json
   create : simple-node-authentication/bin/
   create : simple-node-authentication/bin/www

   change directory:
     $ cd simple-node-authentication

   install dependencies:
     $ npm install

   run the app:
     $ DEBUG=simple-node-authentication:* npm start

$ cd simple-node-authentication/

$ git init

```

1. `npm i -g express-generator`: installs the Express Generator
2. `express -v hbs --git simple-node-authentication`: generates a skeleton for our app
    * The `-v hbs` option tells the generator to use `handlebars` as the view engine instead of `pug`
    * The `--git` option will create a `.gitignore` file with some useful defaults
3. `cd simple-node-authentication`: navigate to the app folder
4. `git init && git add . && git commit -m 'bootstrap with express-generator'`: make sure to keep track of changes
    * This will set up a git repository and save all the generated files in the initial commit.
  From now on, you will just be tracking your changes
5. `npm i`: this installs the dependencies to the `node_modules` directory. The `i` command is short for `install`
    * **Note:** The `node_modules` directory can get notoriously large, and there is a `package-lock.json` filethat keeps track of the exact versions of each dependency you're using. Because of this, best practice is to ignore this folder from source control (e.g. `echo node_modules/ >> .gitignore`). If you ever feel your `node_modules` is corrupted, you can simply `rm -rf node_modules && npm i` to restore the dependencies
6. `npm start`: This is the Node standard command to start a server
    * The `start` script is actually defined inside `package.json`. By default it would be the equivalent of running `node index.js`, but in our case, it is really running `node ./bin/www`.
7. ...
8. Profit!

Your server is now running at http://localhost:3000. Right now it's just a basic "Hello World" app, but you're going to make it a little more useful in a moment.

## Monitor Code Changes in Your Node Application

Having your web server restart automatically each time you make a code change can save you a ton of time as you're developing your web applications. To accomplish this, you can use `nodemon`. To add it to the project, type `npm i nodemon`. Once you've installed `nodemon`, you'll add a `dev` script to your `package.json`:

```diff
   "scripts": {
+    "dev": "nodemon node ./bin/www",
     "start": "node ./bin/www"
   },
```

From now on, instead of running `npm start` to boot up your development server, you can run `npm run dev` and any code changes you make will automatically trigger a web server restart.

## Configure Code Linting

Linters help catch bugs while you're coding rather than waiting for them to crop up in production. They also help keep code styling consistent when collaborating with other contributors. One of the most common linters is `eslint`, which is incredibly configurable. There are many presets out there, but my favorite is called `standard`. They actually have their own tool, based on `eslint`, but it's not possible to customize that, so in this example, I'll go with `eslint` and make a few modifications to the `standard` config.

To do this, create a file in the project root named `.eslintrc` with the following:

```json
{
  "extends": "standard",
  "rules": {
    "comma-dangle": ["error", "always-multiline"],
    "no-var": ["error"],
    "prefer-const": ["error"]
  }
}
```

Now you need to install a few dev dependencies (the `-D` flag is for dev dependencies).

```bash
  npm i -D eslint eslint-config-standard eslint-plugin-standard eslint-plugin-promise eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-node
```

I added a few rules I like. You can tweak these to your liking:

* [comma-dangle](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/comma-dangle) is really just a style preference. I like that if I add a new line to the end of a list, the git history won't show the previously last line as
code I modified
* [no-var](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-var) forces us to use the newer `let` and `const` keywords
for declaring variables. They have proper scoping and tend to be safer to use
* [prefer-const](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-const) will have you use `const` by default, and only use `let` if the variable is going to be re-assigned later

You'll want to add another script to `package.json` for testing:

```diff
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "nodemon node ./bin/www",
+    "test": "eslint . ./bin/www",
     "start": "node ./bin/www"
   },
```

You can now test your codebase at any time using `npm test`. The first time around, there will be quite a few errors because the code from `express-generator` wasn't written using the same config. To fix them in bulk run `./node_modules/.bin/eslint . ./bin/www --fix` from the root of your project.

The `.` says to check the current directory tree for any `.js` files. Since `./bin/www` doesn't have a `.js` extension, but is a JavaScript file as well, you need to add that for it to be scanned.

It turns out `bin/www` actually has some unreachable code that can't be automatically fixed. Let's go fix that real quick. Since `process.exit` will actually end the node process, the `break` keywords are a bit redundant, so you can just remove those.

```diff
@@ -67,11 +67,9 @@ function onError (error) {
     case 'EACCES':

       process.exit(1)
-      break
     default:
       throw error
   }
```

There's pretty good support for using `eslint` within most text editors which allows you to see the errors as you're typing the code. Most of the time, you won't even need to run `npm test`.

You might need to install a plugin to get this to work. To see if your editor is supported,
[check here](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors).

## Add Authentication With Okta

The Express generator created a skeleton for you to get started. Now, let's add authentication. Traditionally, there is a lot to think about when it comes to creating a safe, secure application. For example, what are best practices for storing hashed passwords? Do these best practices change often? Should you use multi-factor authentication? To say there's a lot of research to do this right is an understatement.

Luckily, Okta makes this really easy by offloading authentication and letting you focus on what makes your app unique. To get started [sign up for a free Okta Developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

You'll get a link to your own Okta org URL (e.g. `https://{yourOktaDomain}`). In order to log in, check your email for a temporary password.

After logging into the dev console, click on the **Applications** tab, then click **Add Application**. For this example, you should use the **Web** option.

Express uses port 3000 by default. Here you should name your application and change the ports, but leave all the other settings the same for now. Eventually, you'll want to add URIs for a custom domain, but `localhost` is fine for testing.

{% img blog/simple-node-authentication/create-web-app-settings.png alt:"Okta Create Web App Settings" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

After creating your application, you'll get access to your client credentials. Save the client ID
and client secret for the next step.

## Add the OpenID Connect Middleware to Express.js

Now for some real code. Okta provides Express middleware to make authentication simple in Node.

```
npm i @okta/oidc-middleware@0.1.2 express-session@1.15.6
```

In your `app.js` file you'll want to set up support for sessions and add the OIDC middleware. You'll need to reference the `oidc` middleware in the `bin/www` file, so you should export that as well.

The Okta middleware adds a `logout` function to the request object, so you can log users out with a call to `req.logout()`. That was added above as a route, so you just need a link to `/logout` in order to sign out, which I'll show you a bit later.

For this example you're not going to be using the `users` route that came with the skeleton either, so you can remove that by running `git rm routes/users.js`.

You might be wondering where all the `process.env` variables are coming from. It's a best practice not to store sensitive information in source control, so you can instead use `dotenv`. This lets you keep things like your client secret in a file that you ignore from source control. It also lets you define different variables depending on whether you're running in development or production.

For now, install the package with `npm i dotenv`, then create a `.env` file in the root of the project.

```bash
ORG_URL=https://{yourOktaDomain}
HOST_URL=http://localhost:3000
CLIENT_ID=okta-application-client-id
CLIENT_SECRET=okta-application-client-secret
```

For `APP_SECRET` we just need something random, which can be generated with these commands:

```bash
npm install -g uuid-cli
echo "APP_SECRET=`uuid`" >> .env
```

You still need to tell your code to use environment variables via `dotenv`, and change the way you start the server to work with Okta's middleware. You need the `dotenv` import to be the first code your app comes across to make sure the environment variables are set up properly.

These are the changes you need to make in `bin/www`:

## Add a Dashboard and Login Page

Let's create a private dashboard that's only accessible for logged in users. In `app.js` you already added the reference to your dashboard's router, so you'll need to add that in `routes/dashboard.js`.

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const { startCase } = require('lodash')

const router = express.Router()

router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  const descriptionList = Object.keys(req.userinfo).sort()
    .map(key => ({
      term: startCase(key),
      details: (key === 'updated_at' ? new Date(req.userinfo[key] * 1000) : req.userinfo[key]),
    }))

  res.render('dashboard', {
    title: 'Dashboard',
    descriptionList,
    userinfo,
  })
})

module.exports = router
```

I added `lodash`, so you'll need to install that as a dependency with `npm i lodash@4.17.5`. You'll also want to add a view to describe how to render the data in `views/dashboard.hbs`.

```hbs
{% raw %}
<h1>{{userinfo.given_name}}'s Dashboard</h1>

<p>Here's where you would put something useful. How about your profile info?</p>
<dl>
  {{#each descriptionList}}
    <dt>{{this.term}}</dt>
    <dd>{{this.details}}</dd>
  {{/each}}
</dl>
{% endraw %}
```

## Clean Up the Styling

You can add a header in `views/layout.hbs` that will be visible on every page. As long as the routers pass in `userinfo` to the `render` function, you'll know if the user is signed in. You also want to pass in `title` to set the page's title and set the header.

```hbs
{% raw %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{title}}</title>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='/stylesheets/style.css' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>{{title}}</h1>
      {{#if userinfo}}
        <div>
          Signed in as {{userinfo.name}}
        </div>
      {{/if}}
      {{#if userinfo}}
        <a href="/logout">Sign out</a>
      {{else}}
        <a href="/login">Sign in</a>
      {{/if}}
    </header>
    <main>
      {{{body}}}
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
{% endraw %}
```

The CSS lives in `public/stylesheets/style.css`. Here's how mine looks after making a few changes.

```css
body {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  font: 14px "Lucida Grande", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}

a {
  color: #208075;
}

header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #208075;
  color: white;
  font-size: 16px;
}

header > a {
  color: #d1e5e1;
}

header,
main {
  padding: 50px;
}

dt {
  padding: 4px 0;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## Add a Login Page

It turns out there's not really much to do here. Okta's middleware adds a `/login` route for you, so all you really need to do is add a link. In fact, you don't even need to link to the `/login` page directly. Since your dashboard page uses the `oidc.ensureAuthenticated()` middleware, any time a user tries to go to the dashboard, they will first be directed to log in. After logging in, they'll be redirected back to the intended page.

In `routes/index.js` you want to know if the user's authenticated or not, so you can pass that info to the view with `req.userinfo`. While you're at it, go ahead and change the default title from `Express` to the name of your app.

```diff
{% raw %}
-  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' })
+  res.render('index', {
+    title: 'Simple Node Authentication',
+    userinfo: req.userinfo,
+  })
{% endraw %}
```

In `views/index.hbs`, let's add a link to the dashboard.

```hbs
{% raw %}
<p>Welcome to {{title}}</p>
<p>
  To access your dashboard,
  {{#if userinfo}}
    <a href="/dashboard">click here</a>.
  {{else}}
    <a href="/dashboard">sign in</a>.
  {{/if}}
</p>
{% endraw %}
```

Now when you run the app, you get a page that looks like this:

{% img blog/simple-node-authentication/simple-node-auth-homepage.png alt:"Simple Node Auth Homepage" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Clicking the `log in` link will take you to Okta's sign in page. After signing in, you'll be directed to a dashboard page with your profile info.

{% img blog/simple-node-authentication/simple-node-auth-dashboard.png alt:"Simple Node Auth Dashboard" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

## Add User Registration

You should have a functional app now with authentication and protected pages, created with only a few additions to the basic skeleton app. You don't have any way to add new users though.

Let's create a simple registration page. For this, we'll be using the [Okta Node.js SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-nodejs), which you can install with `npm i @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs@1.1.0`.

You'll also need an API token from Okta to be able to create a user. After logging in to your developer console, select **API** > **Tokens** from the menu.

{% img blog/simple-node-authentication/okta-api-tokens.png alt:"Okta API Tokens" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Create a token with a useful name, like `registration`, then save the value in `.env` as `REGISTRATION_TOKEN`. The value of the token will only be displayed once, so if you lose it you'll need to create a new one.

Now you'll need to create a view and a router for the registration page.

**`routes/register.js`**
```javascript
const okta = require('@okta/okta-sdk-nodejs')
const express = require('express')

const router = express.Router()

const client = new okta.Client({
  orgUrl: process.env.ORG_URL,
  token: process.env.REGISTRATION_TOKEN,
})

const title = 'Create an account'

router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.userinfo) {
    // Logged in users shouldn't be able to register
    return res.redirect('/')
  }

  res.render('register', { title })
})

router.post('/', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    await client.createUser({
      profile: {
        firstName: req.body.firstName,
        lastName: req.body.lastName,
        email: req.body.email,
        login: req.body.email,
      },
      credentials: {
        password: {
          value: req.body.password,
        },
      },
    })

    res.redirect('/dashboard')
  } catch ({ errorCauses }) {
    const errors = errorCauses.reduce((summary, { errorSummary }) => {
      if (/Password/.test(errorSummary)) {
        return Object.assign({ password: errorSummary })
      }

      const [ , field, error ] = /^(.+?): (.+)$/.exec(errorSummary)
      return Object.assign({ [field]: error }, summary)
    }, {})

    res.render('register', { title, errors, body: req.body })
  }
})

module.exports = router
```

When initially loading the page, the fields will be blank. If the `createUser` function throws an error, you'll want to keep the user on the page and display those errors inline. You can pre-populate the fields with the data they entered last time, so they don't have to type everything in again.

**`views/register.hbs`**
```hbs
{% raw %}
<h4>After creating your account, you will be asked to sign in and provide a security question.</h4>
<form method="post">
  <label for="firstname">
    First Name
    <input id="firstname" name="firstName" required value="{{body.firstName}}" />
    <label class="error">{{errors.firstName}}</label>
  </label>
  <label for="lastname">
    Last Name
    <input id="lastname" name="lastName" required value="{{body.lastName}}" />
    <label class="error">{{errors.lastName}}</label>
  </label>
  <label for="email">
    Email address
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required value="{{body.email}}" />
    <label class="error">{{errors.email}}</label>
    <label class="error">{{errors.login}}</label>
  </label>
  <label for="password">
    Password
    <input
      name="password"
      type="password"
      required
      value="{{body.password}}"
    />
    <label class="error">{{errors.password}}</label>
  </label>

  <button type="submit">Register</button>
</form>
{% endraw %}
```

You can now add a link to the homepage in `views/index.hbs`.

```diff
{% raw %}
     <a href="/dashboard">click here</a>.
   {{else}}
     <a href="/dashboard">sign in</a>.
+  </p>
+  <p>
+    If you don't have an account, you can
+    <a href="/register">register for free</a>.
   {{/if}}
 </p>
{% endraw %}
```

Now if you navigate to http://localhost:3000/register, you'll find a registration page.

{% img blog/simple-node-authentication/create-account.png alt:"Create Account" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }

If Okta returns any errors, they will be shown in the form.

{% img blog/simple-node-authentication/account-already-exists.png alt:"Account Already Exists" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }
{% img blog/simple-node-authentication/account-password-requirements.png alt:"Account Password Requirements" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }

## Add Credential Recovery

If a user forgets their password, they will need a way to reset it. Okta's API allows you to send a recovery link to a user's email address. You just need a simple page to ask the user for their email address.

**`views/reset-password.hbs`**
```javascript
{% raw %}
{{#if success}}
  <h4>Please check your inbox for a recovery email!</h4>
{{else}}
  <h4>Enter your email address to have a password recovery email sent to you.</h4>
{{/if}}
<form method="post">
  <label for="email">
    Email address
    <input autofocus type="email" id="email" name="email" required value="{{body.email}}" />
    <label class="error">{{error}}</label>
  </label>

  <button type="submit">Send Recovery Link</button>
</form>
{% endraw %}
```

**`routes/reset-password.js`**
```javascript
const okta = require('@okta/okta-sdk-nodejs')
const express = require('express')

const router = express.Router()

const client = new okta.Client({
  orgUrl: process.env.ORG_URL,
  token: process.env.REGISTRATION_TOKEN,
})

const title = 'Password Recovery'

router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.render('reset-password', { title })
})

router.post('/', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const user = await client.getUser(req.body.email)

    await user.resetPassword()

## Learn More About Node and Secure User Management with Okta

Now you have a fully functioning web application with user registration, authentication, and credential recovery, without having to hash a single password or manage a single user. You can have your cake, and eat it too!

OK, the cake is a lie, but you can now focus on what makes your application great and unique while offloading the complications of user management to Okta. If you'd like to learn more about Node, Okta, authentication, or application security, I'd encourage you to check out the rest of the Okta developer blog, and specifically these great resources:
