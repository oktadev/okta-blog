There are a myriad of state management options available for React. React provides the option of using the built-in [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for when you have a nested tree of components that share a state. There is also a built-in [useState hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) that will allow you to set local state for a component.

For more complex scenarios where you need a single source of truth that changes frequently and is shared across large sections of your application, consider using a more robust state management library.

This walkthrough will get you started with a basic setup using Okta's redirect model to manage authenticated state and user profile information within a React app. It provides examples on when to use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) versus local state using React's `useState` hook versus React Context. 

**Prerequisites**

As of the time of this publication, *Create React App* requires Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6. You can check for the latest required versions at [https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

**NOTE:** Redux also recommends you install the [React Developer Tools Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en).

{% include toc.md %}
## Create the React app using TypeScript

We'll get started with the built-in React template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that uses Redux and TypeScript. This includes the recommended Redux Toolkit and Redux's integration with React components. You can also [clone the GitHub repo](https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-typescript-redux-example) and follow the instructions there to configure it instead of building the project.

1. First, run:
```bash
npx create-react-app okta-react-redux --template redux-typescript
```

**NOTE:** Our demo repository uses React `^18.2.0` and React Scripts `5.0.1`.

2. Then we'll add the Redux core by running:
```bash
npm add redux@4.2
```

3. Redux provides its own types, but we'll want to add our `react-redux` types since we're using TypeScript:
```bash
npm add -D @types/react-redux@7.1
```

4. We'll also need routing (and routing types) for our app:
```bash
npm install react-router-dom@5
npm add -D @types/react-router-dom@5.3
```

5. To start your app, run:
```bash
npm start
```

## How Redux works

To update state using Redux, an action is dispatched. Then the store uses the root reducer to calculate a new state as compared to the old state, which notifies the proper subscribers of the update, so that the UI can be updated properly.

A typical Redux workflow goes like this. First, the UI for your application is rendered using an initial global Redux store, created with the root reducer:

1. An event occurs in the UI of your app, such as a user button interaction, which triggers an action.
2. The action is then dispatched to the store and an event handler that handles the needed logic makes the changes to your global state.
3. The store notifies subscribed parts in the UI that there has been an update.
4. Those subscribed parts then check to see if a re-render is necessary to update the UI as needed. 

**NOTE:** The built-in Redux template we used includes a great counter example of how Redux works. You can take a closer look at [Redux's explanation of the counter example](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples/).

### Useful terms for working with Redux

**[Action](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#reducers)**

An **action** is a JS object with a type and a payload. It describes an actionable interaction within your app, and typically is named something like `createUser` or `addToDo`.

**[Action Creators](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#action-creators)**

**Action creators** can be used to dynamically create actions. Our demo does not use action creators, but you can read more about it at the link above.

**[Reducers](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#reducers)**

When passed a new state, a **reducer** returns the proper current state by comparing it with the previous state, and making the applicable changes. Reducers work similarly to the `Array.reduce` method.

**[Redux store](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store#redux-store)**

The current live state for your app lives in the **Redux store**.

**[Selectors](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#selectors)**

A **selector** returns a piece of the live Redux state as stored in the live Redux store.

**[Dispatch](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#dispatch)**

**Dispatch** is a method that triggers an action, which in turn updates the Redux store.

## Add authentication using OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC)

For this demo app, we'll be using [Okta's SPA redirect model](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa-redirect/react/main/) to authenticate and fetch user info.

{% include setup/cli.md type="spa" framework="React" loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000/login/callback" %}

1. Add the Okta SDKs to your project by running:
```bash
npm install @okta/okta-react@6.4 @okta/okta-auth-js@6.0
```

## TypeScript React application setup with Redux state management

1. Create a `.env` file to your root directory and add the following:
```bash
REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourOktaClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_BASE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000
```

**NOTE:** Remember to not include your `.env` file in any version control for security reasons.

## Add authentication and create routes

Modify the existing `App.tsx` file:
{% raw %}
```tsx
import "./App.css";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { LoginCallback, Security } from "@okta/okta-react";
import Home from "./components/home";
import { useCallback } from "react";

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER,
  clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID,
  redirectUri: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_BASE_REDIRECT_URI + "/login/callback",
});

function App() {
  const restoreOriginalUri = useCallback(
    async (_oktaAuth: OktaAuth, originalUri: string) => {
      window.location.replace(
        toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin)
      );
    },
    []
  );

  return (
    <Router>
      <Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}>
        <Route path="/" exact={true} component={Home} />
        <Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback} />
      </Security>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```
{% endraw %}

## Add initial state, create Redux slice, and create selector

1. Create a `src/redux-state` directory:
```bash
mkdir src/redux-state
```

2. Add a `userProfileSlice.tsx` file in the created `redux-state` directory with the following:
{% raw %}
```tsx
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { RootState } from "../app/store";

export interface IUserProfile {
  email: string;
  given_name: string;
  family_name: string;
}

const initialState: IUserProfile = {
  email: "",
  given_name: "",
  family_name: "",
};

export const userProfileSlice = createSlice({
  name: "userProfile",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setUserProfile: (state, action) => {
      return {
        email: action.payload.payload.email,
        given_name: action.payload.payload.given_name,
        family_name: action.payload.payload.family_name,
      };
    },
  },
});

export const selectUserProfile = (state: RootState): IUserProfile =>
  state.userProfile;

export const { setUserProfile } = userProfileSlice.actions;
export default userProfileSlice.reducer;
```
{% endraw %}

{:start="3"}
3. In the `src/app/store.ts` file, add the created Redux slice to the Redux store:
{% raw %}
```ts
import { configureStore, ThunkAction, Action } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "../features/counter/counterSlice";
import userProfileReducer from "../redux-state/userProfileSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
    userProfile: userProfileReducer,
  },
});

export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppThunk<ReturnType = void> = ThunkAction<
  ReturnType,
  RootState,
  unknown,
  Action<string>
>;
```
{% endraw %}

## Show user profile information with state management

1. Create a `src/components` directory:
```bash
mkdir src/components
```

2. In the `src/components` directory, add the following files:
#### home.tsx

```tsx
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { createContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { setUserProfile } from "../redux-state/userProfileSlice";
import "../App.css";
import Dashboard from "./dashboard";
import { UserClaims } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";

type UserProfileExtra = Pick<UserClaims, "locale" | "preferred_username">;

const emptyUserContext = {
  preferred_username: "",
  locale: "",
} as UserProfileExtra;

export const UserContext = createContext(emptyUserContext);

export default function Home() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();
  const [userProfileExtra, setUserProfileExtra] = useState<UserProfileExtra>();

  const login = async () => oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (authState?.isAuthenticated) {
      oktaAuth
        .getUser()
        .then((userInfo: UserProfileExtra) => {

          dispatch(
            setUserProfile({
              type: "userProfile/userProfileSet",
              payload: userInfo,
            })
          );

          setUserProfileExtra({
            locale: userInfo.locale,
            preferred_username: userInfo.preferred_username,
          });
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          console.error(err);
        });
    }
  }, [authState?.isAuthenticated, dispatch, oktaAuth]);

  return (authState?.isAuthenticated && userProfileExtra) ? (
    <UserContext.Provider value={userProfileExtra}>
      <Dashboard />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  ) : (
    <div className="section-wrapper">
      <div className="title">Use Redux to Manage Authenticated State in a React App</div>
      <button className="button" onClick={login}>
        Login
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here we use React's [`useEffect` hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) to set the global user state we set up earlier with `setUserProfile` and the local user state we set up in this file with [`useState`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).

Once the user is authenticated, we rely on the [`getUser` method](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#getuser) that is built into `oktaAuth` to fetch the user profile information. If the user is not yet authenticated, we render the login page instead.

#### dashboard.tsx

```tsx
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { selectUserProfile } from "../redux-state/userProfileSlice";
import "../App.css";
import { useState } from "react";
import UserProfile from "./userProfile";
import UserProfileExtra from "./userProfileExtra";

export default function Dashboard() {
  const { oktaAuth } = useOktaAuth();
  const userProfile = useSelector(selectUserProfile);
  const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false);

  const logout = async () => oktaAuth.signOut();

  return (
    <div className="section-wrapper">
      <div className="title">Dashboard</div>
      <div className="profile-greeting">{`Hi ${userProfile.given_name}!`}</div>
      <div className="profile-more-wrapper">
        {isExpanded && (
          <>
            <UserProfile />
            <UserProfileExtra />
          </>
        )}
      </div>
      {
        <div
          className="profile-toggle"
          onClick={() => setIsExpanded(!isExpanded)}
        >
          {isExpanded ? "Show less" : "Show more"}
        </div>
      }
      <div>
        <button className="button" onClick={logout}>
          Logout
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this file, we use a Redux selector to get the current state for `userProfile` to then render those values in our component.

We also set an `isExpandable` property that toggles whether or not additional user profile information is hidden or shown. This is another example of how to use local state with the `useState` hook. 

#### userProfile.tsx

```tsx
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { selectUserProfile } from "../redux-state/userProfileSlice";
import "../App.css";

export default function UserProfile() {
  const userProfile = useSelector(selectUserProfile);

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <span>Email: </span>
        {userProfile.email}
      </div>
      <div>
        <span>Last name: </span>
        {userProfile.family_name}
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

In this file, we use the Redux selector created earlier to get the current state for the state slice. This includes the user profile information we set earlier.

#### userProfileExtra.tsx

``` tsx
import "../App.css";
import { useContext } from "react";
import { UserContext } from "./home";

export default function UserProfileExtra() {
  const userProfileExtra = useContext(UserContext);

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <span>Username: </span>
        {userProfileExtra.preferred_username}
      </div>
      <div>
        <span>Locale: </span>
        {userProfileExtra.locale}
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

Here, we demonstrate another way to manage state. This time, React's built-in `useContext` hook is used to get what we set earlier in the `UserContext` we created with React's `createContext` method.

**NOTE:** The following custom styling has also been added to `src/App.css` in the demo repository.

```css
.section-wrapper > div {
  padding: 24px;
  font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;
}

.section-wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: calc(100vh - 100vh * 0.33);
  margin-top: 56px;
}

.button {
  min-width: 64px;
  height: 36px;
  border-color: #6200ee;
  color: #6200ee;
  background-color: transparent;
  border-style: solid;
  padding: 0 15px 0 15px;
  border-width: 1px;
  font-size: 0.875rem;
  font-weight: 700;
  letter-spacing: 0.0892857143em;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  border-radius: 4px;
  border-style: solid;
  padding: 0 15px 0 15px;
  border-width: 1px;
}

.button:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
  background-color: rgb(112, 76, 182, 0.1);
}

.title {
  font-size: 48px;
  text-align: center;
}

.profile-greeting {
  font-size: 32px;
}

.profile-toggle {
  font-size: 16px;
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: #6200ee;
}

.profile-more-wrapper {
  height: 360px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.profile-more-wrapper > div {
  padding: 16px;
}

.profile-more-wrapper span {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 500;
}
```

Our app is now complete! Next we'll run it to log a user in and render our applicable states.

## Running the app

To start the app, run `npm start`.

After your app starts and you've clicked `login` on the home screen, you'll be redirected to the Okta-hosted sign-in page. Here, enter your user credentials. Once your user is authenticated, the dashboard component we created will render.

{% img blog/react-typescript-redux/dashboard.jpg alt:"Screenshot of dashboard." width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

If you recall, the value for the user's `given_name` is part of the Redux slice from our created selector `selectUserProfile`. Clicking `Show more` or `Show less` toggles our local state for `isExpanded` in the dashboard component. This allows us to show or hide additional user profile info, which is a mix of values from the `userProfileSlice` and additional values from the `UserContext` we created. 

## Learn more about authentication, React, and Redux

In this post, we used Okta's redirect model to manage authenticated state and user profile information within a React app. We also looked at examples for when to use Redux, local state using React's `useState` hook, or React context. As you scale your apps, you might find that a mix of all three solutions is the right choice.
