[Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/) is a cloud database product from Microsoft that offers scalable and high-performance services. The core product runs on a proprietary NoSQL database that should look familiar to experienced MongoDB developers. Microsoft offers several APIs in addition to the core Cosmos DB API. These include APIs for:

- SQL
- MongoDB
- Gremlin
- Cassandra

The shift to serverless database operations is one of the most obvious advantages of migrating. Cosmos DB can automatically scale your throughput based on load, rather than the traditional provisioning of throughput in advance.  

As developers, we need to be mindful of how we can protect data at rest. In this article, you will learn how Cosmos DB helps to protect data at rest and what you can do to remove sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII) from data that you intend to store in Cosmos DB.  

### A secure application for PII

One of my first jobs in development was writing applications that would perform a `scrubbing` process on personal data coming from clients. Effectively we would receive data that included the person's name, social security number, and address. This data would then be sent out for verification to a consumer reporting corporation,  and that company would return a result letting us know if the address was current and if the information we'd received was correct. Once the data returned we could import the result into our software and if the scrub came back successful then the account was a valid contact.  

In this tutorial, you will do the same process. You will build an ASP.NET Core web application on .NET 6 that accepts a CSV file with a person's name and social security number. You will send that to a dummy scrub service. Then you will record the results in a Cosmos DB account. But the word has come from your boss that you *cannot* store the social security number. So you will learn how to remove that information from your data model before storing it in Cosmos DB.

To continue you will need:

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- An [free Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/signup) (to handle your OAuth needs)
- [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)
- An [Azure account with a subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

Of course, if you just want to see the code feel free [to view it on Github](https://github.com/oktadev/okta_dotnet_cosmosdb_example).

## Cosmos DB overview

Like most Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings, Cosmos DB provides many features for security and performance. There are too many to list here. Finding the documentation on Microsoft's endless labyrinth of docs is challenging enough. But I do want to touch on a few highlights.  

First, as a PaaS, Microsoft takes responsibility for network controls, host infrastructure, and physical security. They share application-level controls and identity access with you as well as the data classification. Endpoint protection is your responsibility.  

It is important to note though that [Azure is HIPPA compliant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/faq#:~:text=Is%20Azure%20Cosmos%20DB%20HIPAA,of%20individually%20identifiable%20health%20information). Ultimately, the data that you choose to store is your responsibility and subject to laws and regulations that are out of scope for this article.

You should also take a moment to familiarize yourself with the Cosmos DB resource model. I won't go into it too deeply here, but the short version is that a `database account` owns a `database`. The `database` contains `containers`. `Containers` can contain `items`, `stored procedures`, `triggers`, and other objects. In this tutorial, you will create the database account on the Azure portal, but you will create the database, container, and items from your web application.  

The last thing I want to mention is that different Cosmos DB APIs have different methods for removing or encrypting data. In this tutorial, you will work with the core Cosmos DB API, but I encourage you to explore the other APIs.   

## Create your Okta application

{% capture note %}
> Note that the TCP port 5001 must be the same used by the application. You can see it in the messages displayed in the terminal when you start the application with **`dotnet run`**.
{% endcapture %}
{% include setup/cli.md type="web" note=note framework="ASP.NET Core"
   loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback"
   logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:5001/signout/callback" %}

## Create a Cosmos DB account

As I mentioned before, the logic for creating your database, container, and items will be in your application. However, you do need to create a database account to connect to.

Navigate to [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Create a resource**. Search for `Azure Cosmos DB` and select the option. Follow the prompt and select **Create** on the Azure Cosmos DB marketing page.

Next, you will see a page asking which API best suits your workload. Find *Core (SQL) - Recommended* and press **Create**.  

{% img blog/secure-databases-dotnet/cosmos-api.PNG alt:"Cosmos Select API " width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

The **Create Azure Cosmos DB Account - Core (SQL)** page provides the details about your subscription and resource group. Make sure you select `Apply` under the **Apply Free Tier Discount** then press **Review + create**.

{% img blog/secure-databases-dotnet/cosmos-create-account.PNG alt:"Cosmos Create Account" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## Create your web application

Now you can turn your attention toward creating your web application. Open Visual Studio and press **Create a new project**. Find the template for **ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)** and press **Next**. Name your application `Okta_CosmosDb` and press **Next**. Finally, select **.NET 6.0 (Long-term support)** from your framework and press **Create**. Allow Visual Studio a moment to scaffold the project.

Next, you can install the two packages you will need in your project.  

```console
Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 4.1.0
Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos -Version 3.26.1
```

`Okta.AspNetCore` will do all the heavy lifting of connecting your web application to Okta using middleware provided by Okta. This package will just require a quick configuration using the values output to `.okta.env` from your application set up earlier.  

`Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` provides the core libraries for accessing the Cosmos DB API. You will use this package to create your database, add a container to it, and insert items into the container.

Next, open `appsettings.Development.json` and replace the code there with the following.

```JSON
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}",
    "Domain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}"
  },
  "CosmosDb": {
    "Account": "{yourCosmosDbUri}",
    "Key": "{yourCosmosDbPrimaryKey}",
    "DatabaseName": "oktacosmos",
    "ContainerName": "Results"
  }
}
```

You can find the Okta values in `.okta.env` produced by the CLI when you initialized your Okta application. To find your Cosmos values, navigate to your Cosmos DB account page and open the `Settings > Keys` tab. Here you will find the `URI`, `PRIMARY KEY`, and other values you may need down the line.

Next, replace the code in `Program.cs` with the following.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

builder.Services.ConfigureApplicationCookie(options =>
{
    options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
    options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
})
.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
{
    // Replace these values with your Okta configuration
    OktaDomain = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("Okta:Domain"),
    ClientId = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("Okta:ClientId"),
    ClientSecret = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("Okta:ClientSecret"),
    Scope = new List<string> { "openid", "profile", "email" },
    PostLogoutRedirectUri = "/"
});

builder.Services.AddScoped<Okta_CosmosDb.Services.IScrubService, Okta_CosmosDb.Services.ScrubService>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<Okta_CosmosDb.Services.ICosmosService>(Okta_CosmosDb.Services.CosmosService.InitializeCosmosClientInstanceAsync(builder.Configuration.GetSection("CosmosDb")).GetAwaiter().GetResult());

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
    // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

app.Run();
```

Much of this code is boilerplate from the Visual Studio scaffolding process but you are adding a few extra items.

First, you need to configure your authentication to use `AddOktaMvc` and provide the configuration values from your `appsettings` file.

Next, you are setting up the dependency injection for a couple of custom services that you will write soon. These are the `IScrubService`, which will handle your scrubbing process, and the `ICosmosService`, which will handle communication to your Cosmos DB account.

Finally, you are calling `InitializeCosmosClientInstanceAsync`, which will set up your database and container if they do not exist. Then it will return the `CosmosService` as a singleton.  

### Create your application services

Create a new folder in the project root and name it `Services`. You will add the following four files to this directory.

* `ICosmosService.cs`
* `CosmosService.cs`
* `IScrubService.cs`
* `ScrubService.cs`

Start by replacing the code in the two interfaces. First, replace the code in `ICosmosService.cs` with the following.

```csharp
namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Services
{
    public interface ICosmosService
    {
        Task SaveResultAsync(Models.ScrubResult result);
    }
}
```

Next, replace the code in `IScrubService.cs` with the code below.

```csharp
namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Services
{
    public interface IScrubService
    {
        Task<Models.ScrubResult> ScrubAsync(Models.Person person);
    }
}
```

Now you can implement these interfaces in their respective classes. First, open `CosmosService.cs` and update the code there with the code below.

```csharp
using Okta_CosmosDb.Models;
using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Services
{
    public class CosmosService : ICosmosService
    {
        private Container _container; 
        
        public CosmosService(
            CosmosClient dbClient,
            string databaseName,
            string containerName)
        {
            this._container = dbClient.GetContainer(databaseName, containerName);
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Creates a Cosmos DB database and a container with the specified partition key. 
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns></returns>
        public static async Task<CosmosService> InitializeCosmosClientInstanceAsync(IConfigurationSection configurationSection)
        {
            string databaseName = configurationSection.GetSection("DatabaseName").Value;
            string containerName = configurationSection.GetSection("ContainerName").Value;
            string account = configurationSection.GetSection("Account").Value;
            string key = configurationSection.GetSection("Key").Value;

            CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(account, key);
            CosmosService cosmosDbService = new CosmosService(client, databaseName, containerName);
            DatabaseResponse database = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync(databaseName);
            await database.Database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync(containerName, "/id");

            return cosmosDbService;
        }

        public async Task SaveResultAsync(ScrubResult result)
        {
            await this._container.CreateItemAsync<ScrubResult>(result, new PartitionKey(result.Id));
        }
    }
}
```

This service does two tasks. First, it stores data in Cosmos DB using the `SaveResultAsync` method. This simply calls the container you are operating on and creates an item in that container.

This class also contains the static `InitializeCosmosClientInstanceAsync` method, which your `Program.cs` called to return the service. Anytime you attempt to access an `ICosmosService` your application will return a singleton using this method. This method will ensure your database and your container are created before passing the instance of the `CosmosService` to the consumer to be used.  

Next open `ScrubService.cs` and replace the code there with this implementation.

```csharp
using Okta_CosmosDb.Models;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Services
{
    public class ScrubService : IScrubService
    {
        public async Task<ScrubResult> ScrubAsync(Person person)
        {
            var task = Task.Run(() => { return new ScrubResult(person, new Random().Next(2) == 0); });
            return await task;
        }
    }
}
```

This class serves to mock a true scrub service. The method here is `async` because in a real-world environment that would be the case, but since you are just mocking the service you can wrap the login in `Task.Run` to simulate an `async` method.

### Create your models

Next, you will need a couple of data models to facilitate your views and to pass in your application. In your `Models` folder add a file for `ScrubResult.cs` and add the following code to it.

```csharp
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Models
{
    public class ScrubResult
    {
        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "id")]
        public string Id { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "person")]
        public Person Person { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "success")]
        public bool Success { get; set; }

        public ScrubResult(Person person, bool success)
        {
            Person = person;
            Success = success;
            Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        }
    }
}
```

Now add the file and code for `Person.cs` in your `Models` folder.

```csharp
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Models
{
    public class Person
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [JsonIgnore]
        public string SSN { get; set; }
    }
}
```

There are a couple of things going on here that you should understand. First, you are going to store the `ScrubResult` object in your Cosmos database. Each property is explicitly given a name using the `JsonProperty` attribute, however you do not need to do this. You do need a field called `id`.  The `JsonProperty` attribute helps keep your C# code consistently [Pascal case](https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase) while keeping your Cosmos DB property names camel case.  

The real kicker here is that the API is using the `Newtonsoft.Json` package to serialize the objects into JSON strings. This means you can use any of the features that come with the Newtonsoft package to manipulate your data. This is what you did on the `Person` object where you use the `JsonIgnore` attribute to hide the SSN.

While `JsonIgnore` is the simplest way to remove the SSN from this object, there are many other approaches. You could even create a custom attribute using the `Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.DefaultContractResolver`, and hash, encrypt, or otherwise translate the field into something less sensitive.  

### Add the controller logic

Now you can add your controller logic to your application.

Start by adding a class to your `Controllers` directory named `ImportController.cs`. Replace the code with the following.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class ImportController : Controller
    {
        Services.IScrubService _scrubService;
        Services.ICosmosService _cosmosService;

        public ImportController(
            Services.IScrubService scrubService,
            Services.ICosmosService cosmosService
            )
        {
            _scrubService = scrubService;
            _cosmosService = cosmosService;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult Upload(IFormFile csvFile)
        {
            List<Models.Person> persons = new List<Models.Person>();

            using (var stream = csvFile.OpenReadStream())
            using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(stream))
            {
                while (!sr.EndOfStream)
                {
                    string[] rows = sr.ReadToEnd().Split(Environment.NewLine);          
                    
                    for(int i =0; i < rows.Length; i++)
                    {
                       if(i == 0)
                        {
                            //header row
                            continue;
                        }

                        var row = rows[i].Split(',');

                        persons.Add(new Models.Person()
                        {
                            Name = row[0],
                            SSN = row[1]
                        });
                    }
                }
            }

            List<Models.ScrubResult> results = new List<Models.ScrubResult>();

            foreach(var person in persons)
            {
                results.Add(_scrubService.Scrub(person));
            }

            foreach(var result in results)
            {
                _cosmosService.SaveResultAsync(result);
            }

            return View(results);
        }
    }
}
```

This controller will serve as a view for the import page. It will also accept a CSV file, convert the file into a list of `Person` objects, and then run the scrub process against each person. Once the scrub process is complete it will save the results to your Cosmos DB account using the database you set up earlier.  

Next, you will want a controller for logging users in and out. Add a controller called `AccountController.cs` and replace the code with the following.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult SignIn()
        {
            if (!(HttpContext.User?.Identity?.IsAuthenticated ?? false))
            {
                return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Import");
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult SignOut()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(new[] { OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                                         CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme });
        }
    }
}
```

This controller contains methods for `SignIn` and `SignOut` implemented per Okta's recommendation.  

Finally, replace the code in `HomeController.cs` with the code below.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Okta_CosmosDb.Models;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger<HomeController> _logger;

        public HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            if ((User?.Identity?.IsAuthenticated ?? false))
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Import");

            return View();
        }

        [ResponseCache(Duration = 0, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None, NoStore = true)]
        public IActionResult Error()
        {
            return View(new ErrorViewModel { RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier });
        }
    }
}
```

Here you have the `Index` method but the logic is replaced to redirect authenticated users to the Import screen.  

### Add and edit your views

The first view to edit is the `_Layout.cshtml` in your `Views/Shared` folder.  

```html

                    }
                    else

Most of the boilerplate layout is fine but it doesn't include `Login` or `Logout` buttons. You added these to the navbar and displayed the appropriate one based on the user's authentication status.

Next, replace the `Home\Index.cshtml` code with the following.
```html
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
}

<div class="text-center">
    A small tutorial on protecting PII in Microsoft's <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/"> Azure Cosmos DB</a>.
    <br />Secured by <a href="https://www.okta.com/free-trial/">Okta.</a> <br />
    Written by <a href="https://github.com/nickolasfisher"> Nik Fisher.</a>
</div>
```

This is just a little home page with some information about the tutorial.

Finally, create a new folder (if one wasn't created already) for `Import` in your `Views` folder. Add a file called `Index.cshtml` with the following code.

```html
@(ViewData["Title"] = "Import Clients")

<form method="POST" asp-controller="Import" asp-action="Upload" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" name="csvFile" class="btn-outline-primary btn" />
    <input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" value="Import" />
</form>
```

This simple page provides an opportunity for the user to import a CSV file and submit it to the server.  

Next, add a file for `Upload.cshtml` that will display the results as they come back.

```html
@model List<Okta_CosmosDb.Models.ScrubResult>
@(ViewData["Title"] = "Scrub Results")

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Result</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var result in Model)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>@result.Person.Name</td>
                <td>@result.Success</td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

### Test your application locally

With your application complete you can now start debugging. You should be greeted with the home screen.

Click on **Login** and follow the login page to Okta and then back to your import page. Download the [CSV File found here](https://github.com/nickolasfisher/Okta_Cosmos/blob/master/Okta_CosmosDb/TestData/SampleFile.csv) and upload this to your server using the application page.

Your application will then process this file and save the results to Cosmos DB. You can navigate to your Cosmos DB portal using the `Data Explorer`.

You will note that the social security number does not appear in the data you sent to Cosmos DB.

## Conclusions

As developers, we always need to be thinking about protecting users' data. The rise of PaaS and SaaS platforms has decreased risk when used properly. But along with these new platforms, we must make sure we use best practices and keep an attentive eye on the data we choose to retain.  

In this tutorial, you learned how to store data in Cosmos DB from an ASP.NET Core application. You learned how to set up your Cosmos DB account and how to set up your application to create databases and containers to store your items. Finally, you used the JSON functionality to remove sensitive data from your data model before storing it.
