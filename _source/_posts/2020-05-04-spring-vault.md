In 2013, GitHub released a search feature that allows users to scan code all public repositories. A day after the release, however, they had to partially shut it down. It was speculated that the shutdown was because the feature allowed any user to search for all kinds of secrets stored in GitHub repositories. Later, in 2014, data on 50,000 Uber drivers was stolen. It seems someone got access to the company's database using login credentials found in a GitHub public repository. Hashicorp Vault, a tool for managing secrets and encrypting data in transit, was first announced in 2015 and Spring Vault, the integration of Spring with Vault was first released in 2017.

It seems like a long time ago, right? Secrets leakage seems to remain pervasive and constant, happening to all kinds of developersâ€”as explained by [this study from NC State University](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/how-bad-can-it-git-characterizing-secret-leakage-in-public-github-repositories/). Exposed secrets leads to cyber-attacks, data loss or corruption, sensitive data breaches, and crypto-jacking (cryptocurrency mining using a victim's cloud computer power). With tools like Hashicorp's Vault and Spring Cloud Vault, the risk can be reduced.

Nowadays it is widely recommended to never store secret values in code. Therefore, this tutorial will demonstrate the following alternatives:

- Using environment variables for Spring Boot secrets
- Secrets encryption with Spring Cloud Config
- Secrets management with HashiCorp's Vault
- Using Spring Cloud Vault

**Prerequisites**: [Java 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)+ and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Use Environment Variables for Secrets; a Precursor to Spring Vault

Spring Boot applications can bind property values from environment variables. To demonstrate, create a `vault-demo-app` with OpenID Connect authentication, using the Spring Initializr. Then add `web`, `okta`, and `cloud-config-client` dependencies, some of which will be required later in the tutorial:

```shell
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  -d bootVersion=2.2.6.RELEASE \
  -d dependencies=web,okta,cloud-config-client \
  -d groupId=com.okta.developer \
  -d artifactId=vault-demo-app  \
  -d name="Spring Boot Application" \
  -d description="Demo project of a Spring Boot application with Vault protected secrets" \
  -d packageName=com.okta.developer.vault \
  -o vault-demo-app.zip
```

Unzip the file and open the project. Modify its `src/main/java/.../Application.java` class to add the `/` HTTP endpoint:

```java
package com.okta.developer.vault;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

    @GetMapping("/")
    String hello(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user) {
        return String.format("Welcome, %s", user.getFullName());
    }

}
```

For the Okta authentication set up, register for a [free developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/). After you log in, go to **API** > **Authorization Servers** and copy your Issuer URI into a text editor.

Then go to **Applications** and create a new **Web** application. Configure it as follows:

- Name: `Vault Demo`
- Base URIs: `http://localhost:8080/`
- Login redirect URIs: `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta`
- Logout redirect URIs: `http://localhost:8080`
- Grant type allowed: 
  - [x] Authorization Code
  - [x] Refresh Token

Click **Done** and copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** into a text editor for later.

Instead of storing Okta credentials in `application.properties`, Spring Boot allows you to bind properties from environment variables. You can see this in action by starting your application with the Maven command below:

```shell
SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OKTA_ISSUER_URI={yourIssuerURI} \
SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId} \
SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret} \
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

In an incognito window, go to `http://localhost:8080`. Here, you should see the Okta login page:

{% img blog/spring-vault/okta-login.png alt:"Okta login form" width:"500" %}{: .center-image }

In the application logs, you'll see the security filter chain initializes an OAuth 2.0 authentication flow:

```

```

Using environment variables for passing secrets to containerized applications is now considered bad practice because the environment can be inspected or logged in a number of cases. So, let's move on to using Spring Cloud Config server for secrets storage.

## Spring Cloud Config with Secrets Encryption

In microservice architectures, managing configuration with a centralized config server is essential. Secret encryption is desirable at rest and when in transit. Spring Cloud Config Server is a popular implementation. Let's configure the server to store encrypted secrets.

**NOTE:** To use encryption and decryption features in Java 8, you must install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) in your JVM, which is not included by default. Otherwise, the requests to the `/encrypt` endpoint in the config server will fail with "Illegal key size". 

Using the Spring Initializr API, create a Vault + Config Server application:

```shell
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  -d bootVersion=2.2.6.RELEASE \
  -d dependencies=cloud-config-server \
  -d groupId=com.okta.developer \
  -d artifactId=vault-config-server  \
  -d name="Spring Boot Configuration Server" \
  -d description="Demo project of a Spring Boot application with Vault protected secrets" \
  -d packageName=com.okta.developer.vault \
  -o vault-config-server.zip
```

Unzip the downloaded file. Rename `src/main/resource/application.properties` to `src/main/resource/application.yml`, edit the file to specify the port, add a `native` profile, and specify config search locations:

```yml
server:
  port: 8888

spring:
  profiles:
    active: native
```

Edit `src/main/java/com/okta/developer/vault/SpringBootConfigurationServerApplication.java` and add a `@EnableConfigServer` annotation:

```java
package com.okta.developer.vault;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.config.server.EnableConfigServer;

@EnableConfigServer
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootConfigurationServerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootConfigurationServerApplication.class, args);
    }

}
```

Start the server, as you are going to encrypt your Okta secrets using the `/encrypt` endpoint. For this example, you are using a symmetric (shared) encryption key, passed through the environment variable ENCRYPT_KEY. Before running the command below, you should replace `{encryptKey}` with a random string of characters.

```shell
ENCRYPT_KEY={encryptKey} ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Then, in another terminal, encrypt your client ID and secret. 

```shell
curl localhost:8888/encrypt -d {yourOktaClientId}
curl localhost:8888/encrypt -d {yourOktaClientSecret}
```

In the `vault-config-server` project folder, create a `src/main/resources/config/vault-demo-app-dev.yml` file to store the secrets for the `dev` profile, with the following contents:

```yml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          okta:
            issuer-uri: {yourIssuerURI}
        registration:
          okta:
            client-id: '{cipher}encryptedClientId'
            client-secret: '{cipher}encryptedClientSecret'
```

The `client-id` and `client-secret` encrypted values must be prefixed with `{cipher}`. Restart the config server.

To consume the config server properties, the client application must set the server address in the bootstrap properties. In the `vault-demo-app` project folder, create the file `src/main/resources/bootstrap.yml` with the following content:

```yml
spring:
  application:
    name: vault-demo-app
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8888
  profiles:
    active: dev
```

Start `vault-demo-app` without passing the environment variables:

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

When requesting `http://localhost:8080` it should again redirect to the Okta login.

In a real environment, the config server should be secured. Spring Cloud Config Server supports asymmetric key encryption as well, with the server encrypting with the public key, and the clients decrypting with the private key. However, the documentation warns about spreading the key management process around clients.

## Vault as a Configuration Backend with Spring Cloud Vault

{% img blog/spring-vault/vault-logo.png alt:"Vault logo" width:"300" %}{: .pull-right }

In the cloud, secrets management has become much more difficult. Vault is a secrets management and data protection tool from HashiCorp that provides secure storage, dynamic secret generation, data encryption, and secret revocation. 

Vault encrypts the secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage. The encryption key is also stored in Vault, but encrypted with a _master key_ not stored anywhere. The master key is split into shards using _Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm_, and distributed among a number of operators. The Vault unseal process allows you to reconstruct the master key by adding shards one at a time in any order until enough shards are present, then Vault becomes operative. Operations on secrets can be audited by enabling audit devices, which will send audit logs to a file, syslog or socket.

As Spring Cloud Config Server supports Vault as a configuration backend, the next step is to better protect the application secrets by storing them in Vault.

Pull the Vault docker image and start a container using the command below. Make sure to replace `{hostPath}` with a local directory path, such as `/tmp/vault`.

```shell
docker pull vault
docker run --cap-add=IPC_LOCK \
-e 'VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' \
-p 8200:8200 \
-v {hostPath}:/vault/logs \
--name my-vault vault
```

**NOTE**:  The `docker run` command above will start a vault instance with the name `my-vault`. You can stop the container with `docker stop my-vault` and restart it with `docker start my-vault`. Note that all the secrets and data will be lost between restarts, as explained in the next paragraphs.

IPC_LOCK capability is required for Vault to be able to lock memory and not be swapped to disk, as this behavior is enabled by default. As the instance is run for development, the ID of the initially generated root token is set to the given value. We are mounting `/vault/logs`, as we are going to enable the `file` audit device to inspect the interactions. 

Once it starts, you should notice the following logs:
```
...
WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

...

The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: wD2mT9W56zGWrG9PYajIA47spzSLEkIMYQX7Ocio1VQ=
Root Token: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!

==> Vault server started! Log data will stream in below:
```

It is clear Vault is running in _dev mode_, meaning it short-circuits a lot of setup to insecure defaults, which helps for the experimentation. Data is stored encrypted in-memory and lost on every restart. Copy the _Unseal Key_, as we are going to use it to test Vault sealing.
Connect to the container and explore some vault commands:

```shell
docker exec -it my-vault /bin/sh
```

The command above will start a shell session with the container. After the prompt shows, run the following three commands:

```shell
export VAULT_TOKEN="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
export VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"
vault status
```

The `status` command output shows if the vault instance is sealed:

```
Key             Value
---             -----
Seal Type       shamir
Initialized     true
Sealed          false
Total Shares    1
Threshold       1
Version         1.3.3
Cluster Name    vault-cluster-a80e6cd6
Cluster ID      769bfd8c-7c9e-5ef2-a2bd-667ae19b4180
HA Enabled      false
```

As you can see, in development mode Vault starts unsealed, meaning stored data can be decrypted/accessed.

Enable a file audit device to watch the interactions with Vault:

```shell
vault audit enable file file_path=/vault/logs/vault_audit.log
```

You should see a success message. Now store the Okta secrets for the `vault-demo-app`:

```shell
vault kv put secret/vault-demo-app,dev \
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-id="{yourClientId}" \
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-secret="{yourClientSecret}" \
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.issuer-uri="{yourIssuerURI}"
vault kv get secret/vault-demo-app,dev
```

As illustrated above, key-value pairs are stored with `kv put` command, and you can check the values with the `kv get` vault command.

Check `vault_audit.log` in your specified `{hostPath}` directory. Operations are logged in JSON format by default, with sensitive information hashed:

```json
{
   "time":"2020-05-01T02:08:49.528995105Z",
   "type":"response",
   "auth":{...},

      "operation":"read",
      "client_token":"...",
      "client_token_accessor":"...",
      "namespace":{
         "id":"root"
      },
      "path":"secret/data/vault-demo-app,dev",
      "remote_address":"127.0.0.1"
   },
   "response":{

            "spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.oidc.client-secret":"hmac-sha256:d6c38a298b067ac8ce76c427bd060fdda8558a024ebb1a60beb9cde60d9e5db8"
         },
         "metadata":{
            "created_time":"hmac-sha256:b5283ce3fbb0bb7a74c91e2e565e08d44d378d2e37946b1fa871e0c23947a6c1",
            "deletion_time":"hmac-sha256:81566d1c06213e53b6f7cf141388772d1ab59efcc4cfa9373c32098d90bda09a",
            "destroyed":false,
            "version":1
         }
      }
   }
}
```

Let's assume you don't want to configure the root token in the `vault-demo-app`. You can instead create a policy granting read permissions on the path where the secrets were stored. Go to the Vault Web UI at `http://localhost:8200` and log in with the root token (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`).

{% img blog/spring-vault/vault-web-ui.png alt:"Vault web UI" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, go to **Policies** and **Create ACL policy**. Create a `vault-demo-app-policy` with the following capabilities:

```json
path "secret/data/vault-demo-app" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}

path "secret/data/vault-demo-app,dev" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}

path "secret/data/application" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}

path "secret/data/application,dev" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}
```

All the paths above will be requested by the config server to provide configuration for the `vault-demo-app` when it starts with the `dev` profile active.

{% img blog/spring-vault/vault-policy.png alt:"Vault policy section" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Now, go back to the container command line, and create a token with the `vault-demo-app-policy`.

```shell
vault token create -policy=vault-demo-app-policy


Key                  Value
---                  -----
token                s.4CO6wzq0M1WRUNsYviJB3wzz
token_accessor       2lYfyQJZtGPO4gyxsLmOnQyE
token_duration       768h
token_renewable      true
token_policies       ["default" "vault-demo-app-policy"]
identity_policies    []
policies             ["default" "vault-demo-app-policy"]
```

You are now ready to update the config server. In the `vault-config-server` project, edit `src/main/resource/application.yml` to add Vault as the config backend:

```yml
server:
  port: 8888

spring:
  profiles:
    active: vault
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        vault:
          host: 127.0.0.1
          port: 8200
          kvVersion: 2
logging:
  level:
    root: TRACE         
```

Note that the logging level is set to TRACE to see the interaction between the server and Vault. Restart the `vault-config-server`.

```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You should see the logs below if the server was configured correctly:

```
2020-05-01 01:19:10.105  INFO 14072 --- [main] SpringBootConfigurationServerApplication: 
 Started SpringBootConfigurationServerApplication in 4.525 seconds (JVM running for 4.859)
```

You will not see the config server trying to connect to Vault in the logs. That will happen when a config client requests the properties. Start the `vault-demo-app`, passing the token just created in the environment variable `SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_TOKEN`. For example:

```shell
SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_TOKEN=s.4CO6wzq0M1WRUNsYviJB3wzz \
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

When the `vault-demo-app` starts, it will request the configuration to the config server, which in turn will make a REST to Vault. In the config server logs, with enough logging level, you will be able to see:

```
2020-05-01 01:21:02.691 DEBUG 21168 --- [nio-8888-exec-1] o.s.web.client.RestTemplate: 
 HTTP GET http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/data/vault-demo-app,dev
```

> To increase logging so you see the above message, add the following to `application.properties`
> 
> ```
> logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
> ```

Go to `http://localhost:8080` and verify that authentication with Okta works.

Finally, let's seal Vault. Sealing allows you to lock Vault data to minimize damages when an intrusion is detected.  In the container command line, enter:

```shell
vault operator seal
```

Restart `vault-demo-app` and verify the configuration will not be retrieved as Vault is sealed. The `vault-config-server` logs should read:

```
503 Service Unavailable: [{"errors":["error performing token check: Vault is sealed"]}
```

To unseal Vault, run:

```shell
vault operator unseal {unsealKey}
```
