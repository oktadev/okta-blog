GraphQL is an incredibly powerful query language for APIs that helps improve performance and extensibility in your APIs. The query language is designed to allow developers to query exactly the data they need. As your API grows in size and scope, current consumers are unaffected by changes since their queries should return the same data.  

Apollo Client is a state management library for JavaScript. It fits seamlessly into React applications and can handle fetching, caching, and modifying application data.  

In this application, you will create a small React application that uses Apollo Client to query a GraphQL API that contains the data for SpaceX's launches. You will display an overview of launch histories to the user and allow the user to drill down into a specific launch. To secure the application you will use Okta's `okta-react` library to make setting up your authentication easy.

If you prefer to watch the demo, you can view this walk through.

## Create your Okta Application

The first thing you will need a free developer account from Okta. if you don't have one you can [sign up for one here.](https://developer.okta.com/signup/). Once you have completed that navigate to your developer's console and click on **Applications** and then **Add Application**. Select **Single Page App** and click **Next**.   

Give your application a meaningful name. You will also need to change your URIs to *localhost:3000* as this is the default in React.

{% img blog/graphql-apollo-react/okta-app-settings.png alt:"Okta App Settings" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click on **Done**. On the application management page, you will be presented with your *Client id*. Make note of this as you will need it in your application.

## Create Your Apollo and React Application

Next, you will create your web application. Navigate to the parent directory where your application will be stored and use the command `npx create-react-app apollo-demo`. After your application is finished scaffolding you will need to install the required dependencies. First, you will be using bootstrap and react-bootstrap because it makes creating web pages simple.

```console
npm i bootstrap@4.5.3
npm i react-bootstrap@1.4.0
```

Next, you will need to get Okta's core javascript and react packages. With these packages, setting up your authentication with Okta only takes a few short minutes.

```console
npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@4.4.0
npm i @okta/okta-react@4.1.0
```

You will need the `graphql` and `apollo-client` packages to connect to the graphQL API that you will use for your data.

```console
npm i @apollo/client@3.3.4
npm i graphql@15.4.0
```

Finally, you will use dotenv to store your sensitive data during development.

```console
npm i dotenv@8.2.0
```

With dotenv installed, you can create a new file in the root of your application called .env and add the following code to it.

```javascript
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE={yourOktaDomain}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Now you want to start building your application by editing the `App.js` file. Open `App.js` and replace the code with the following.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import AppWithRouterAccess from './AppWithRouterAccess';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
import { ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';

const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://api.spacex.land/graphql/',
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <ApolloProvider client={apolloClient}>
        <AppWithRouterAccess />
      </ApolloProvider>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Most of this should look fairly familiar. You are importing the bootstrap `CSS` files at this level. You also need to instantiate your `apolloClient` and pass it into the `ApolloProvider` component that wraps `AppWithRouterAccess`. Per Apollo's documentation, you should put the `ApolloProvider` as high up in your application as necessary so that all the children components can access it. The `AppWithRouterAccess` contains the logic for implementing Okta and securing routes.  

Create a new file in your `src` directory called `AppWithRouterAccess.jsx` and add the following code.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Security, SecureRoute, LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

import Home from './Pages/Home'
import Blastoff from './Pages/Blastoff'

const AppWithRouterAccess = () => {
    const issuer = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE + '/oauth2/default'
    const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
    const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + '/callback';

    const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
        issuer: issuer,
        clientId: clientId,
        redirectUri: redirect
      });      

    return (
        <Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth}>
            <Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home} ></Route>
            <SecureRoute path='/Blastoff' component={Blastoff} />
            <Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback} />
        </Security>
    );
};
export default AppWithRouterAccess;
```

Here you are creating a new instance of `OktaAuth` and passing it into your `Security` component that is provided by Okta. The `SecureRoute` component is used to check if the user is logged in. If the user is not, they will be redirected to the Okta login page.  

Now you can focus on creating your pages and components. First, add two new folders to your `src` directory; `Pages` and `Components`. In `Pages`, add a new file called `Home.jsx`. Add the following code to it.

{% raw %}
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Link, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';

import Header from '../Components/Header'
import { Container, Row, Col, Card } from 'react-bootstrap'


import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

const Home = () => {

  const { authState } = useOktaAuth();

  return (authState.isAuthenticated ?
    <Redirect to={{ pathname: '/Blastoff' }} /> :

    <Container>

      <Header></Header>

      <Row>

        <Col sm={12} className="text-center">

              <Link to='/Blastoff'>Login Here</Link>

        </Col>

      </Row>

      <footer className="text-muted text-center">

  );
};
export default Home;
```
{% endraw %}

This page serves two major needs. First, it provides a landing page for your users and gives some further reading about the technologies used on the site. Second, it contains a redirect to the `Blastoff` page if the user is already logged in. This second part isn't strictly necessary but you can change the workflow if you feel so inclined.  

Next, you can implement the code for the `Blastoff` page. Add a new file to your `Pages` directory called `Blastoff.jsx` and add the following code.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import Header from '../Components/Header'
import { Container } from 'react-bootstrap'

import Histories from '../Components/Histories';
import History from '../Components/History';

class Blastoff extends Component {

    constructor(props, context) {
        super(props, context);

        this.state = {
            loading: false,
            showHistory: false,
            shownHistoryId: -1
        }

        this.onHistorySelected = this.onHistorySelected.bind(this);
        this.onReturnToHistories = this.onReturnToHistories.bind(this);
    }

    onHistorySelected (id) {
        this.setState({
            showHistory: true,
            shownHistoryId: id
        });
    }

    onReturnToHistories () {
        this.setState({
            showHistory: false,
            shownHistoryId: -1
        });
    }

    render () {

        if (this.state.loading) {
            return <Container>
                <Header></Header>
                <h4>Loading, please wait.</h4>
            </Container>
        }

        if (this.state.showHistory) {
            return (
                <Container>
                    <Header></Header>
                    <History id={this.state.shownHistoryId} onReturnToHistories={this.onReturnToHistories}></History>
                </Container >
            )
        }

        return (
            <Container>
                <Header></Header>
                <Histories onHistorySelected={this.onHistorySelected}></Histories>
            </Container >
        );
    }
}

export default Blastoff;
```

This page is the showcase of your application. Users will land on this page and be able to see all the detail your application offers.  It has two modes, one to show all the histories available and one to show the details on a specific history. When the user first lands on this page, you will display the `Histories` component. If the user clicks on the title of a launch they will be presented with the details of that launch on a different component.  

Next, add a new file to your `Components` directory and add a file called `Histories.jsx`. The code for that component is as follows.

```javascript
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

import { Container } from 'react-bootstrap'

function Histories ({ onHistorySelected }) {

    const HistoriesQuery = gql`{
            histories {
              id
              details
              links {
                article
              }
              flight {
                id
                mission_name
              }
            }
          }`;

    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(HistoriesQuery);

    if (loading) {

        return (<Container>
            <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/3f1d85ab9951d0db65e797c7f40e89cc/tenor.gif"></img>
        </Container>);
    }
    else {
        return (
            <Container>
                <table className="table table-striped">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Mission Name</th>
                            <th>Details</th>
                            <th>Article</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        {data.histories.map((history, i) => {
                            return <tr key={i}>
                                <td><a href="#" onClick={() => onHistorySelected(history.id)}>{history.flight == null ? "Unnamed" : history.flight.mission_name}</a> </td>
                                <td>{history.details}</td>
                                <td><a href={history.links.article} target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Read Article</a></td>
                            </tr>
                        })}
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </Container>
        )
    }
}

export default Histories;
```

This component does the heavy lifting for displaying the histories to the user. Since you are using the `useQuery` hook, you will need to use it in a React function component. From this hook, you can get the `loading`, `error`, and `data` values. These allow you to build the component itself. If the data is still loading, you can present the user with a waiting gif of a classic space race moment. If there is an error you can display a brief error message. And once the data is returned, you can build a table with the data you wish to display to the user. Note here that the first column contains the `mission_name` and an `onClick` handler to tell the `Blastoff` page to load the detail.

For a detailed history, add a new file called `History.jsx` to the `Components` folder and add the following code.

```javascript
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';
import { Container, Row } from 'react-bootstrap'

function History ({ id, onReturnToHistories }) {

  const HistoryQuery = gql`         
          query history($historyId: ID!) {
                    history(id: $historyId) {
                      details
                      event_date_unix
                      flight {
                        rocket {
                          rocket_name
                        }
                        launch_date_utc
                        launch_site {
                          site_name
                        }
                        launch_success
                      }
                      event_date_utc
                    }
                  }
                `;

  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(HistoryQuery, { variables: { historyId: id }, });

  if (loading) {
    return (
      <Container>
        <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/3f1d85ab9951d0db65e797c7f40e89cc/tenor.gif"></img>
      </Container>);
  }
  if (error) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(error, null, 2));
    return (<div>error</div>);
  }
  else {

    var successLabel;

    if (data.history.flight.launch_success) {
      successLabel = <span className="text-success">Success!</span>
    }
    else {
      successLabel = <span className="text-danger"> Failed ):</span>
    }

    return (
      <Container>
        <Row>
          <div className="col-lg-3">
            <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={() => onReturnToHistories()}>Return</button>
          </div>
        </Row>

        <Row>
          <div className="col-lg-3">
            Launch Time UTC:
          </div>
          <div className="col-lg-3">
            {data.history.event_date_utc}
          </div>
          <div className="col-lg-3 text-right">
            Success?
           </div>
          <div className="col-lg-3">
            {successLabel}
          </div>
        </Row>
        <Row>
          <div className="col-lg-3">
            Launch Site:
          </div>
          <div className="col-lg-3">
            {data.history.flight.launch_site.site_name}
          </div>
        </Row>
        <Row>
          <div className="col-lg-3">
            Rocket Name:
          </div>
          <div className="col-lg-3">
            {data.history.flight.rocket.rocket_name}
          </div>
        </Row>
        <Row>
          <div className="col-lg-3">
            Details:
          </div>
        </Row>
        <Row>
          <div className="col-lg-12">
            {data.history.details}
          </div>
        </Row>
      </Container>
    )
  }
}

export default History;
```

Again, you obtain the `loading`, `error`, and `data` values from the `useQuery` hook, but this time you need a value for the `gql`. The reason is that you only want to get the data for one history. The `gql` itself is a little different as it fetches more data than the overview. This is one of the powerful features of graphQL, you only need to request the data you *need* which reduces the overhead.  

Finally, in your components folder, add a file called `Header.jsx`. This file will provide links for your users as well as the logic for a login/logout button.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

import { Navbar, Nav, Form, Button } from 'react-bootstrap'

const Header = () => {
    const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

    if (authState.isPending) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    const button = authState.isAuthenticated ?
        <Button variant="secondary" onClick={() => { oktaAuth.signOut("/") }}>Logout</Button> :
        <Button variant="secondary" onClick={() => { oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect("/Blastoff") }}>Login</Button>

    return (

        <Navbar bg="light" expand="lg">
            <Navbar.Brand href="/">BlastOff!</Navbar.Brand>
            <Navbar.Toggle aria-controls="basic-navbar-nav" />
            <Navbar.Collapse id="basic-navbar-nav">
                <Nav className="mr-auto">
                    <Nav.Link href="/">Home</Nav.Link>
                    <Nav.Link href="/Blastoff">History</Nav.Link>
                </Nav>
                <Form inline>
                    {button}
                </Form>
            </Navbar.Collapse>
        </Navbar>

    );
};
export default Header;
```

## Test Your Apollo and React Application

Your code is now complete. Use the command `npm run start` to start running your application. First, you will be shown the `Home` page. Click on either **Login** or **Blastoff!**. You will be presented with the Login screen hosted by Okta. Login in with your Okta account and you will be directed to the `Blastoff` page to review the launches from SpaceX.
