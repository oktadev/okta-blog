Adopting a microservice architecture provides unique opportunities to add failover and resiliency to your systems, so
your components can handle load spikes and errors gracefully. Microservices make change less expensive too. It can also
be a good idea when you have a large team working on a single product. Your project can likely be broken up into components
that can function independently of one another. Once components can function independently, they can be built, tested,
and deployed independently. This gives an organization and its teams the agility to develop and deploy very quickly.

In a [previous article](/blog/2017/04/26/bootiful-development-with-spring-boot-and-angular), I showed you how to build
a Spring Boot API with an Angular client. I then showed you how to
[convert the Angular app into a progressive web application that works offline](/blog/2017/05/09/progressive-web-applications-with-angular-and-spring-boot).
The Angular PWA is a good example of a resilient application because it still works when connectivity fails. Did you know
you can develop similar resiliency in your API with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and a microservices architecture? This
article shows you how to convert the previously created Spring Boot application to use microservices. You'll create a
beer catalog service, an edge service (for filter and displaying good beers), and a Eureka service that registers the
services and allows them to communicate with one another.

Before we dive into the code tutorial, I'd like to talk a bit about microservices, their history, and why you should
(or should not) consider a microservices architecture for your next project.

## History of Microservices

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices#History), the term "microservice" was first used as
a common architecture style at a workshop of software architects near Venice in May 2011. In May 2012, the same group
decided "microservices" was a more appropriate name.

[Adrian Cockcroft](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriancockcroft), who was at Netflix at the time, described this architecture
as "fine-grained SOA". Martin Fowler and James Lewis wrote an article titled simply
[Microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) on March 25, 2014. Years later, this is still
considered the definitive article for microservices.

### Organizations and Conway's Law

Technology has traditionally been organized into technology layers: UI team, database team, operations team. When teams
are separated along these lines, even simple changes can lead to a cross-team project sucking down huge chunks of time
and budget.

A smart team will optimize around this and choose the lesser of two evils; forcing the logic into whichever application
they have access to. This is an example of [Conway's Law](http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html) in action.

{% img blog/microservices-spring-boot/conways-law.png alt:"Conway's Law" width:"560" %}{: .center-image }

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the
> organization's communication structure.

### Microservices Architecture Philosophy

The philosophy of a microservices architecture is essentially equal to the Unix philosophy of "Do one thing and do it well".
The characteristics of a microservices architecture are as follows:

* Componentization via services
* Organized around business capabilities
* Products not projects
* Smart endpoints and dumb pipes
* Decentralized governance
* Decentralized data management
* Infrastructure automation
* Design for failure
* Evolutionary design

## Why Microservices?

For most developers, dev teams, and organizations, it's easier to work on small "do one thing well" services. No single
program represents the whole application, so services can change frameworks (or even languages) without a massive cost.
As long as the services use a language agnostic protocol (HTTP or lightweight messaging), applications can be written
in several different platforms - Java, Ruby, Node, Go, .NET, etc. - without issue.

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers and containers have made it easy to deploy microservices. All the technologies
needed to support a monolith (e.g. load balancing, discovery, process monitoring) are provided by the PaaS, outside of
your container. Deployment effort comes close to zero.

### Are Microservices the Future?

Architecture decisions, like adopting microservices, are usually only evident several years after you make them.
Microservices have been successful at companies like LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix. But that doesn't
mean they'll be successful for your organization. Component boundaries are hard to define. If you're not able to create
your components cleanly, you're just shifting complexity from inside a component to the connections between the components.
Also, team capabilities are something to consider. A weak team will always create a weak system.

> You shouldn't start with a microservices architecture. Instead, begin with a monolith, keep it modular, and split it
> into microservices once the monolith becomes a problem.

> — Martin Fowler

## Build a Microservices Architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Netflix Eureka

Netflix Eureka is a REST-based service that is primarily used in the AWS cloud for locating services for the purpose of
load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers.

[Spring Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/) is a developer's dream when it comes to implementing and
deploying a microservices architecture.

> Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems
> (e.g. configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, micro-proxy, etc.).
> Coordination of distributed systems leads to boilerplate patterns. Using Spring Cloud, developers can quickly stand up
> services and applications that implement those patterns. They will work well in any distributed environment, including
> the developer's own laptop, bare metal data centers, and managed platforms such as Cloud Foundry.

[Spring Cloud Netflix](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/) provides Netflix OSS integrations for Spring Boot
applications. Patterns provided include Service Discovery (Eureka), Circuit Breaker (Hystrix), Intelligent Routing (Zuul)
and Client Side Load Balancing (Ribbon).

To learn more about service discovery and resolution with Eureka, watch Josh Long's
[Microservice Registration and Discovery with Spring Cloud and Netflix's Eureka](https://spring.io/blog/2015/01/20/microservice-registration-and-discovery-with-spring-cloud-and-netflix-s-eureka).

### Create a Eureka Service

To begin, create a `spring-boot-microservices-example` directory on your hard drive. Navigate to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io).
Enter `eureka-service` as an artifact name and select `Eureka Server` as a dependency.

{% img blog/microservices-spring-boot/eureka-service.png alt:"Eureka Server" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click the **Generate Project** button and expand `eureka-service.zip` into the `spring-boot-microservices-example` directory.

> **TIP:** You could also create your project using start.spring.io's API. The following [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) command will create the same app as the steps above:
> ```
> http https://start.spring.io/starter.zip artifactId==eureka-service bootVersion==2.0.5.RELEASE \
>    name==eureka-service dependencies==cloud-eureka-server baseDir==eureka-service | tar -xzvf -
> ```

Modify `eureka-service/src/main/resources/application.properties` to add a port number and disable registration.

```
server.port=8761
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
```

Open `eureka-service/src/main/java/com/example/eurekaservice/EurekaServiceApplication.java` and add `@EnableEurekaServer` above `@SpringBootApplication`.

```java
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.server.EnableEurekaServer;

@EnableEurekaServer
@SpringBootApplication
```

This annotation, and the aforementioned properties, configures a registry that other applications can talk to.

Start the application from the command line using:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Or if you're using Windows:

```bash
mvnw.bat spring-boot:run
```

After it starts, you should be able to open `http://localhost:8761` and see there are no services available.

{% img blog/microservices-spring-boot/eureka-service-ui.png alt:"Eureka Server" width:"800" %}

### Create a Beer Catalog Service

Refresh [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) to start creating a new project. Use `beer-catalog-service` for the
artifact name and add the following dependencies:

* Actuator: features to help you monitor and manage your application
* Eureka Discovery: for service registration
* JPA: to save/retrieve data
* H2: an in-memory database
* Rest Repositories: to expose JPA repositories as REST endpoints
* Web: Spring MVC and embedded Tomcat
* DevTools: to auto-reload the application when files change
* Lombok: to reduce boilerplate code

{% img blog/microservices-spring-boot/beer-catalog-service.png alt:"Beer Catalog Service" width:"800" %}

Click the **Generate Project** button and expand `beer-catalog-service.zip` into `spring-boot-microservices-example` and
open the project in your favorite IDE. I recommend [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) because it's great for
Java and web development.

> **TIP:** To create this same project using start.spring.io's API, run the following:
> ```
> http https://start.spring.io/starter.zip artifactId==beer-catalog-service bootVersion==2.0.5.RELEASE \
>   name==beer-catalog-service dependencies==actuator,cloud-eureka,data-jpa,h2,data-rest,web,devtools,lombok \
>   baseDir==beer-catalog-service | tar -xzvf -
> ```

Create a `Beer` entity, a `JpaRepository` for it, and a `CommandLineRunner` to populate the database with default data.
You can add this code to `BeerCatalogServiceApplication.java`, or create separate files for each class. The code below
assumes you're putting all classes in the same file.

```java
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@Entity
class Beer {

    public Beer(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String name;
}

@RepositoryRestResource
interface BeerRepository extends JpaRepository<Beer, Long> {}

@Component
class BeerInitializer implements CommandLineRunner {

    private final BeerRepository beerRepository;

    BeerInitializer(BeerRepository beerRepository) {
        this.beerRepository = beerRepository;
    }

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        Stream.of("Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout", "Good Morning", "Very Hazy", "King Julius",
                "Budweiser", "Coors Light", "PBR")
                .forEach(beer -> beerRepository.save(new Beer(beer)));

        beerRepository.findAll().forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

If you're using an editor that doesn't auto-import classes, here's the list of imports needed at the top of `BeerCatalogServiceApplication.java`.

```java
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.annotation.RepositoryRestResource;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import java.util.stream.Stream;
```

Add an application name in `beer-catalog-service/src/main/resources/application.properties` to display in the Eureka
service, and set the port to 8080.

```properties
server.port=8080
spring.application.name=beer-catalog-service
```

Start the beer-catalog-service with Maven (`mvn spring-boot:run`) or your IDE.

At this point, you should be able to use [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) to see the list of beers from the catalog service.

```bash
http :8080/beers
```

{% img blog/microservices-spring-boot/httpie-beers.png alt:"HTTPie Beers" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

However, if you open the Eureka Service at `http://localhost:8761`, you will not see the service registered. To register
the beer-catalog-service, you need to add `@EnableDiscoveryClient` to `BeerCatalogServiceApplication.java`.

```java
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;

@EnableDiscoveryClient
@SpringBootApplication
public class BeerCatalogServiceApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(BeerCatalogServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

Re-compile this class, watch devtools restart your application, and return to `http://localhost:8761`. If you're not
using an IDE, it might be easiest to cancel and restart `mvn spring-boot:run`. Now the service should show up.

<div style="padding: 12px 12px 12px 25px; border: 1px solid silver; border-left: 5px solid #ddd">
<strong>Compile on Save in IntelliJ</strong><br>

<p>By default IntelliJ IDEA does not automatically compile files when the application is running.
To enable the "Compile on save" feature:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Go to <strong>Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler</strong> and enable "Build project automatically"</li>
    <li>Open the Action window:

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Enter <strong>Registry...</strong> and enable <code>compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running</code></li>
</ul>

</div>

### Create an Edge Service

The edge service will be similar to the standalone beer service created in
[Bootiful Development with Spring Boot and Angular](/blog/2017/04/26/bootiful-development-with-spring-boot-and-angular).
However, it will have fallback capabilities which prevent the client from receiving an HTTP error when the service is
not available.

Navigate to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) and create an `edge-service` application with the following dependencies:

* Eureka Discovery: for service registration
* Feign: a declarative web service client
* Zuul: provides intelligent routing
* Rest Repositories: to expose JPA repositories as REST endpoints
* Web: Spring MVC and embedded Tomcat
* Hystrix: a circuit breaker to stop cascading failure and enable resilience
* Lombok: to reduce boilerplate code

{% img blog/microservices-spring-boot/edge-service.png alt:"Edge Service" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click the **Generate Project** button and expand `edge-service.zip` into `spring-boot-microservices-example` and open
the project in your favorite IDE.

> **TIP:** To create this same project using start.spring.io's API, run the following:
> ```
> http https://start.spring.io/starter.zip artifactId==edge-service bootVersion==2.0.5.RELEASE \
>   name==edge-service  dependencies==cloud-eureka,cloud-feign,cloud-zuul,data-rest,web,cloud-hystrix,lombok \
>   baseDir==edge-service | tar -xzvf -
> ```

Since the `beer-catalog-service` is running on port 8080, you'll need to configure this application to run on a different
port. Modify `edge-service/src/main/resources/application.properties` to set the port to 8081 and set an application name.

```properties
server.port=8081
spring.application.name=edge-service
```

To enable Feign, Hystrix, and registration with the Eureka server, add the appropriate annotations to
`EdgeServiceApplication.java`:

```java
package com.example.edgeservice;

import com.netflix.hystrix.contrib.javanica.annotation.HystrixCommand;
import lombok.Data;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.EnableCircuitBreaker;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.feign.EnableFeignClients;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.feign.FeignClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.zuul.EnableZuulProxy;
import org.springframework.hateoas.Resources;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

@EnableFeignClients
@EnableCircuitBreaker
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@EnableZuulProxy
@SpringBootApplication
public class EdgeServiceApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EdgeServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

Create a `Beer` DTO (Data Transfer Object) in this same file. Lombok's
[`@Data`](https://projectlombok.org/features/Data.html) will generate a `toString()` methods, getters, setters, and
appropriate constructors.

```java
@Data
class Beer {
    private String name;
}
```

Create a `BeerClient` interface that uses Feign to talk to the `beer-catalog-service`.

```java
public class EdgeServiceApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EdgeServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}

@Data
class Beer {
    private String name;
}

@FeignClient("beer-catalog-service")
interface BeerClient {

    @GetMapping("/beers")
    Resources<Beer> readBeers();
}
```

Create a `RestController` below the `BeerClient` that filters out less-than-great beers and exposes a `/good-beers` endpoint.

**NOTE:** To get `beer.getName()` to work in your IDE, you may need to install the Lombok plugin. In Intellij, you can
install it by going to Preferences -> Plugins -> Browse Plugins. Search for "lombok plugin" and click to install it.
Restart Intellij for the changes to take effect.

```java
@RestController
class GoodBeerApiAdapterRestController {

    private final BeerClient beerClient;

    public GoodBeerApiAdapterRestController(BeerClient beerClient) {
        this.beerClient = beerClient;
    }

    @GetMapping("/good-beers")
    public Collection<Beer> goodBeers() {
        return beerClient.readBeers()
                .getContent()
                .stream()
                .filter(this::isGreat)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    private boolean isGreat(Beer beer) {
        return !beer.getName().equals("Budweiser") &&
                !beer.getName().equals("Coors Light") &&
                !beer.getName().equals("PBR");
    }
}
```

Start the `edge-service` application with Maven or your IDE and verify it registers successfully with the Eureka server.

{% img blog/microservices-spring-boot/edge-service-registered.png alt:"Edge Service Registered" width:"800" %}

You should be able to invoke the `/good-beers` endpoint as well.

```bash
$ http :8081/good-beers
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Date: Fri, 11 May 2018 17:28:55 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```
```json
[
    {
        "name": "Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout"
    },
    {
        "name": "Good Morning"
    },
    {
        "name": "Very Hazy"
    },
    {
        "name": "King Julius"
    }
]
```

This is cool, but if you shut down the `beer-catalog-service` application, you'll get a 500 internal server error.

```bash
$ http :8081/good-beers
HTTP/1.1 500
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Date: Fri, 11 May 2018 17:35:39 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```
```json
{
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "message": "connect timed out executing GET http://beer-catalog-service/beers",
    "path": "/good-beers",
    "status": 500,
    "timestamp": "2018-05-11T17:35:39.201+0000"
}
```

To fix this, you can use Hystrix to create a fallback method and tell the `goodBeers()` method to use it.

```java
public Collection<Beer> fallback() {
    return new ArrayList<>();
}

@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "fallback")
@GetMapping("/good-beers")
public Collection<Beer> goodBeers() {
    return ...
}
```

Restart the `edge-service` and you should see an empty list returned.

```bash
$ http :8081/good-beers
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Date: Fri, 11 May 2018 17:38:18 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```
```json
[]
```

Start the `beer-catalog-service` again and this list should eventually return the full list of good beer names.

### Add an Angular PWA Client

You can copy the Angular PWA client I created in a [previous tutorial](/blog/2017/05/09/progressive-web-applications-with-angular-and-spring-boot) and install its dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-angular-pwa-example.git
cp -r spring-boot-angular-pwa-example/client ~/spring-boot-microservices-example/.
cd ~/spring-boot-microservices-example/client
npm install
```

Then modify the `BeerService` in `client/src/app/shared/beer/beer.service.ts` to **use port 8081** instead of `8080`.

```typescript
getAll(): Observable<any> {
  return this.http.get('http://localhost:8081/good-beers');
}
```

Modify `GoodBeerApiAdapterRestController` in `EdgeServiceApplication.java` to allow cross-origin requests from any client.

```java
@GetMapping("/good-beers")
@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")
public Collection<Beer> goodBeers() {
```

Restart the `edge-service` and start the Angular client by running `npm start` in the client directory.

Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser and verify that network calls to `/good-beers` go over port `8081`.

{% img blog/microservices-spring-boot/angular-pwa.png alt:"Angular PWA Client" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

### Deploy to Cloud Foundry

In order to deploy the `edge-service` and `beer-catalog-service` to Cloud Foundry, you need to add configuration files
so they work with Cloud Foundry's Eureka service.

Create `edge-service/src/main/resources/application-cloud.properties` and populate it with the following:

```properties
eureka.instance.hostname=${vcap.application.uris[0]:localhost}
eureka.instance.nonSecurePort=80
eureka.instance.metadataMap.instanceId=${vcap.application.instance_id:${spring.application.name}:${spring.application.instance_id:${server.port}}}
eureka.instance.leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds = 5

eureka.client.region = default
eureka.client.registryFetchIntervalSeconds = 5
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=${vcap.services.pwa-eureka-service.credentials.uri}/eureka/
```

Create `beer-catalog-service/src/main/resources/application-cloud.properties` and populate it with similar properties.

```properties
eureka.instance.hostname=${vcap.application.uris[0]:localhost}
eureka.instance.nonSecurePort=80
eureka.instance.metadataMap.instanceId=${vcap.application.instance_id:${spring.application.name}:${spring.application.instance_id:${server.port}}}
eureka.instance.leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds = 5

eureka.client.region = default
eureka.client.registryFetchIntervalSeconds = 5
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=${vcap.services.pwa-eureka-service.credentials.uri}/eureka/
```

In the properties above, `pwa-eureka-service` is the name you'll give to the Eureka service when you deploy it to
Cloud Foundry.

To deploy it on Cloud Foundry with [Pivotal Web Services](http://run.pivotal.io/), you'll need to create an account,
download/install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads), and sign-in
(using `cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io`).

There are quite a few steps involved to deploy all the services and the Angular client for production. For that reason,
I wrote a [`deploy.sh`](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/spring-boot-microservices-example/blob/master/deploy.sh) script
that automates everything.

**TIP:** If you receive an error stating that you're using too much memory, you may have to upgrade your Cloud Foundry subscription.

## When to Use Microservices

Building a microservices architecture is something you should consider when you're having difficulty scaling development
in a large team. From a development standpoint, moving to microservices will not reduce complexity, but will likely
increase it you move to a distributed system. Automation and orchestration are key for deployment. You should make sure
to define your exit criteria (e.g. maximum time for a request to execute) before implementing your microservices
infrastructure. You're likely going to have to custom build some things, so be prepared for that. Trial a few different
platforms and then pick the one that meets your criteria and is the easiest to develop with. Don't develop half of your
system on one platform and then try moving to another. Another tip is to make sure and record the request ID in all
logging events for traceability.

If you have fewer than 20 developers, start with a monolith, but build in async messaging as soon as possible. Use it
for things like mail, notifications, logging, and archiving. Debugging, deployment, and logging are much easier with a
monolith because everything is contained in one application.

Also, consider using async messaging or other non-blocking communication methods with automatic back pressure. HTTP is a
synchronous protocol and can be a limiting factor in high-traffic systems.
