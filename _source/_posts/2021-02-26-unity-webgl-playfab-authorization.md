As game creators, we hold a fundamental responsibility to protect and secure any and all data that our players entrust to us. Historically, security in games has not been high on the priority list because games were enjoyed anonymously and offline. But with our society becoming ever more connected, demand for social gaming experiences and online gaming features has increased exponentially. This has led to the development of cloud-based gaming platforms, such as [PlayFab](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/what-is-playfab), that handle everything from multiplayer server hosting, leaderboard tracking, virtual economy, data/analytics, and much more. Even games that are mostly considered "offline" are seeing increased demand for some connected functionality. As more games are developed in the cloud (or developed with cloud-based platforms) and track an increasingly large amount of user data, security is becoming one of the highest priorities for the games community.  

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/p_soti_stuffing.jpeg alt:"SOTI Credential Stuffing" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

In their 2020 [State of the Internet / Security](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-security-gaming-you-cant-solo-security-report-2020.pdf) report, Akamai tracked 100 Billion credential stuffing attacks from June 2018 to June 2020 and found that 10 Billion of these attacks were targeted at gamers. It is not just up to the player or the distribution platform to take security seriously. Players expect that the game companies producing the product that they are trusting their data to will also be keeping them secure.

In [Identity Security for Games in C# with Unity](/blog/2020/08/21/unity-csharp-games-security), we took a look at the extreme basics of storing and authenticating users in a Unity project. That example is a great starting point for the fundamentals, providing a "hello world" concept within the Unity editor. I want to expand upon how the design can change depending on the build target and how to make use of a player's authorization by passing it into other back-end platforms. To do this, we will be building a [WebGL](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-gettingstarted.html) application in [Unity](https://unity.com/) that authenticates player's and authorizes them to [Azure Playfab](https://playfab.com/); where their player data will be stored. Here is a conceptual overview of what this will look like:

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/p_Unity_Playfab_Auth.png alt:"PlayFab SDK" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## Prerequisites

- Sign up for a free [Azure Playfab account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-US/sign-up).
- Sign up for a free [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

- Download and install [Unity](https://unity.com/).
- Create a new Unity project from Unity Hub with the 3D template
- Download and configure the [Playfab Unity SDK and Editor Extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/sdks/unity3d/quickstart)

## Build Target and Design

For this project, I will be targeting [Unity WebGL](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-gettingstarted.html). The build target is important because different platforms will require different means of facilitating user interaction.

In [Identity Security for Games in C# with Unity](/blog/2020/08/21/unity-csharp-games-security ), I described both native and [OAuth](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc) design concepts. While building out a user interface for authentication natively in the engine might seem like the best approach because of user experience, it is not the preferred approach for security, and it typically adds much more effort for the developer. This is because it requires the developer to build out logic supporting the entire [authentication state machine](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#transaction-state); securely handling every event, every MFA state, registration, MFA enrollment, user self service (account unlock and password reset), etc.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/p_state_model.png alt:"Auth Model" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Prebuilt widgets can simplify the amount of effort in this regard. However, developers would still be asking a player to enter their password into an untrusted UI that the developer is responsible for and typically not able to fully keep secure. This is why OAuth is considered the best practice standard for authorization within the security industry, and utilizing a security platform's hosted login experience is considered the most secure way to handle authentication. Players will be entering their credentials into a trusted browser window and a trustworthy security platform. Best of all, developers can share the responsibility of keeping the login experience with the security platform, which is much easier and more secure than attempting to do it all themselves.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/8_popup.png alt:"Popup" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Ok, great. But how does this relate to the build target? The browser. OAuth relies on a browser to facilitate user authentication, which must validate the user identity before providing authorization. Every platform will have a different, platform-specific way of presenting the user with a browser to interact with. For WebGL, the game is already running in a browser, so a simple pop up is all that is needed. But if the build target were Android, [Chrome Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/multidevice/android/customtabs/) would instead be needed to embed the browser into the app. Similarly, if the build target was iOS, [Safari View Controller](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller) would be needed to embed the browser into the app. For full-screen games on a PC, it would be better to use a [device code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/device-code/) concept, similar to a TV or IoT device, or even authenticate the player before launching the game client; from an external launcher application interacting with the default browser on the operating system. The browser interaction and design will change for every platform and device. When designing the authentication experience, the build target will heavily influence the rest of the design.

The good news is that once the target is defined and the browser interaction decided, the rest of the code should be similar across all platforms. This is thanks to the shared responsibility with a security platform's hosted login experience and a standardized authorization specification. The job of the developer is to securely provide a platform-preferred browser experience for the user and direct them to the OAuth authorize endpoint. Once the user has authenticated, the browser is closed, and an auth code is captured in client code to be exchanged for tokens behind the scenes. With tokens in hand, user authorization can be passed to all other backend cloud platforms; providing a centralized, and secure, identity security design that drastically simplifies the implementation effort.

With a build target in mind, lets look at how to code this in Unity.

## Create the Project

First, if you have not already done so, create a new project from `Unity Hub` with the `3D` template.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/1_NewProject.png alt:"New Project" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, configure the Playfab Unity SDK and Editor Extensions using the [Unity Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/sdks/unity3d/quickstart) provided by PlayFab.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/2_Playfab.png alt:"PlayFab" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Create a new scene by clicking **File**, **New Scene** and save it in the projects `Assets` > `Scenes` folder.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/3_NewScene.png alt:"New Scene" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Change the project to targetWebGL by, clicking **File**, **Build Settings**, **WebGL**, and then click **Switch Platform**.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/4_BuildSettings.png alt:"Build Settings" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

> Note: If you did not install WebGL when you installed this copy of the editor, you would be prompted to do so now.

Make sure that your newly created scene is checked in the `Scenes In Build` menu, and then close the `Build Settings` UI.

> Note: If you do not see your scene, click the **Add Open Scenes** button in the bottom right of the `Scenes In Build` menu.

Right-click in the `Scene Hierarchy` panel and click **UI**, **Button**.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/5_NewButton.png alt:"New Button" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

This will be the button that triggers the authentication request.

Right click the button in the `Hierarchy` panel,  click **Rename** and name the button `Sign In.`

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/6_RenameButton.png alt:"Rename Button" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }

Expand the `Sign In` button in the `Hierarchy` panel to expose its text object and select it.

Change the text of the button in the `Inspector` panel to `Sign In.`

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/7_ButtonText.png alt:"Button Text" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## Interact With the Browser

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/8_popup.png alt:"Popup" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

With the project ready, the next thing needed is a way for the [WebGL object to interact with the browser](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-interactingwithbrowserscripting.html) HTML that is holding it. This is because the C# in Unity will be called when the user clicks the `Sign In` button and that C# code needs to instruct the browser to render a popup window for the user to complete authentication.

To do this, a jslib is used to act as the middleman between the C# in Unity and the JavaScript in the WebGL objects parent page.

Open up a preferred text editor, create a new file called `OAuth.jslib`, and save it in your project's `Assets` > `Plugins` folder.

Add the following to `OAuth.jslib` and save it.

```js
mergeInto(LibraryManager.library, 
{
        startAuthentication: function (utf8String) 
        {
                var authRequest = UTF8ToString(utf8String);
                var authorizationRequest = authRequest;
                startAuth(authorizationRequest);
        }
});
```

This code very simply takes an OAuth authorization request URI, passed to it from the calling C# in Unity, and passes it to a corresponding startAuth() function in the parent page's JavaScript. This `startAuth()` function will instruct the browser to open a popup and redirect to the OAuth authorization URI passed to it by the C# in Unity. The WebGL object calls the jslib which runs in the browser, allowing it to interact with the code running in the browser where the WebGL object cant.

Next, create the `startAuth()` function in the JavaScript within the WebGL's parent page so that the C# can interact with it via the `OAuth.jslib`. To do this, start by building the WebGL project in Unity, which will generate an `index.html` that renders the WebGL object.

Click **File**, **Build Settings** and then click **Build**.

Select a preferred output folder and then click **Select Folder**.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/9_build.png alt:"Build" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Once the build process is complete, open the output folder and then open the `index.html` file in a preferred text editor. The contents of `index.html` may vary depending on if you are on Windows or Mac and depending on what version of the editor you are using. The important thing to note in what Unity generates is that there should be a `<script>` element towards the top of the HTML that contains the following:

```js
<script>
        var unityInstance = UnityLoader.instantiate("unityContainer", "Build/WebGL2.json", {onProgress: UnityProgress});
</script>
```

`unityInstance` is the container that holds the WebGL object. This is how the page's JavaScript will be able to call back to the C# code in Unity using:

```js
unityInstance.SendMessage(objectName, methodName, value);
```

Find the `<body>` tags in the HTML and locate the closing `</body>` tag. Right before the closing tag, at the end of body, add the following:

```js
<script>
function startAuth(authorizationRequest) 
{
        window.addEventListener('message', function (e) 
        {
                unityInstance.SendMessage("OAuth2", "getAuthResults", data);
        }, false);

        var childwin;
        const childname = "Authenticate";
        childwin = window.open(authorizationRequest, childname, 'height=300px, width=500px');

        childwin.focus();
};
</script>
```

This is the JavaScript function that the `Sign In` button in the WebGL object will trigger. The button does this by first calling a function in C# on its click event. That function will then call the `OAuth.jslib` which will then call this `startAuth()` function in the page JavaScript. This represents the best way for WebGL to provide browser interaction to the player from within the WebGL object.

```js
window.addEventListener('message', function (e) 
{
        unityInstance.SendMessage("OAuth2", "getAuthResults", data);
}, false);
```

`window.addEventListener()` creates an event listener that will be called by a child popup window when authentication is complete. The result of authentication will be an `Auth Code` sent back to the C# in the WebGL object via `unityInstance.SendMessage()`.

```js
var childwin;
const childname = "Authenticate";
childwin = window.open(authorizationRequest, childname, 'height=300px, width=500px');
```

With the event listener ready, `window.open()` is used to create a popup window to the OAuth authorization request URI.

Finally, `childwin.focus();` ensures that the popup focuses on the user to interact with.

Now that the WebGL's parent page can initiate the authentication process and wait for a response from the authentication process, the next thing that is needed is a separate `callback.html` page for the OAuth authorization server to redirect the user back to after authentication. Because the authentication process is happening in the parent pages popup window, the `callback.html` page will also be rendered after authentication is successful. This will allow the `callback.html` page to receive the resulting `Auth Code` and send it back to the parent page via the event listener.

In the same folder as `index.html` create a new file called `callback.html` using a preferred text editor. The HTML in this page should be designed based on project needs, but it typically will not be rendered long enough for a player to see it. Add the following and customize the HTML as desired:

```js
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
<head>
    <script>
        //Parse query string helper function
        function getParameterByName(name, url = window.location.href) 
        {
                name = name.replace(/[\[\]]/g, '\\$&');
                var regex = new RegExp('[?&]' + name + '(=([^&#]*)|&|#|$)'), results = regex.exec(url);

                if (!results) 
                {
                        return null;
                }

                if (!results[2]) 
                {
                        return '';
                }

                    return decodeURIComponent(results[2].replace(/\+/g, ' '));
        }

        //Get auth code from query string
        var code = getParameterByName('code');
        //Get state from query string
        var state = getParameterByName('state');

        window.opener.postMessage(code + "," + state, "*")
     
        try 
        {
                window.close();
        }
        catch (e) { console.log(e) }

        try 
        {
                self.close();
        }
        catch (e) { console.log(e) }       
    </script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

`getParameterByName()` is a helper function that will parse the `Auth Code` and OAuth `State` from the query string.

`window.opener.postMessage()` sends the `State` and `Auth Code` to the parent window's event listener so that it can send them back to a callback function in the WebGL's C#.

Finally, the popup window is closed, putting the player back on the parent page where the WebGL object is waiting for authentication to complete.

With the browser portion of the project complete, the next step is to create the OAuth code in Unity that will be called by the `Sign In` button's on click event.

> Note: Now that customizations have been made to `index.html`, it will need to be backed up and replaced every time the project is built because Unity will overwrite it each time.

## Adding OAuth

### Configure an Authorization Server

Many OAuth authorization solutions exist today. [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) is the industry-leading, best of breed, identity security platform on the market and allows for creating an unlimited number of OAuth Authorization servers quickly and easily.

Okta provides the easy-to-use [Okta CLI](/blog/2020/12/10/introducing-okta-cli), which will simplify the registration and setup process. First, [Install the Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com/) for your preferred operating system. With the CLI installed, run the following command:

```sh
okta register
```

Follow the instructions to register for a new Okta account. The CLI will handle the Okta configuration automatically. If you already have an Okta account use the following command instead:

```sh
okta login
```

> Note: `okta login` requires a valid [Okta API Token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/create-the-token/) to be entered. This will be stored in the CLI's `okta.yaml` file locally.

Next, run the following command to set up an OAuth app.

```sh
okta apps create
```

Give the app a name, and select option *2*, `Single Page App`, for the application type.

The `Redirect URI` needs to point to where the `callback.html` page will be hosted. Use the following URI format, replacing `appName` with a name that will be used later when deploying the Unity project to Azure App Services.

`https://appName.azurewebsites.net/callback.html`

The `Post Logout Redirect URI` will need to point to where the `index.html` page will be hosted. Use the following URI format, again replacing `appName` with a name used later when deploying the Unity project to Azure App Services.

`https://appName.azurewebsites.net/callback.html`

Finally, select the `default` authorization server if prompted.

The CLI will create the application and return an `Issuer` along with a `Client ID.` Make sure to take note of both which will be used when creating the OAuth script.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/11_OktaCLI.png alt:"Okta CLI" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

### Create the OAuth Script

In Unity, install [Newtonsoft.Json for Unity](https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity) using the instructions outlined in the library repo.

Next, create a new folder in the `Assets` folder and name it `Scripts`.

Right Click in the scripts folder, click **Create**, and then select **C# Script**. Name the script `OAuth` and double click to open it in Visual Studio.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/10_CreateScript.png alt:"Create Script" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Start by referencing the following libraries:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using UnityEngine.Networking;
```

Next, create a new class called `OAuth` and declare the needed instance variables to hold the client's OAuth configuration.

> Note: The instance variables could pull from a preferred configuration solution, or be exposed to the editor for configuration if desired.

```csharp
public class OAuth2 : MonoBehaviour
{
    [DllImport("__Internal")]
    private static extern void startAuthentication(string authRequest);

    // OAuth2 Client Configuration
    private const string clientID = "{clientId}";
    private const string authorizationEndpoint = "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize";
    private const string tokenEndpoint = "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token";
    private const string userInfoEndpoint = "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo";
    private const string redirectURI = "https://appName.azurewebsites.net/callback.html";

    private string state;
    private string code_verifier;
}
```

Notice `DllImport` referencing the `startAuthentication()` function from the jslib at the start of the class. This is importing the jslib so that it can be called from the script.

The OAuth endpoints to be used are defined in the instance variables and the URI to the `callback.html`.

Enter the `Okta Domain` for your Okta org where indicated in the code above. Change `appName` in the `redirectURI` variable to match the app name used when configuring the approved redirectURI in Okta. Remember, this app name will be used later when hosting the project on Azure App Services.

Create a new function called `Authenticate()` to be called by the `Sign In` button's on click event.

```csharp
public void Authenticate()
{
        // Generates state and PKCE values.
        state = randomDataBase64url(32);
        code_verifier = randomDataBase64url(32);
        string code_challenge = base64urlencodeNoPadding(sha256(code_verifier));
        const string code_challenge_method = "S256";

        // Creates the OAuth 2.0 authorization request.
        string authorizationRequest = string.Format("{0}?response_type=code&scope=openid%20profile&redirect_uri={1}&client_id={2}&state={3}&code_challenge={4}&code_challenge_method={5}",
            authorizationEndpoint,
            System.Uri.EscapeDataString(redirectURI),
            clientID,
            state,
            code_challenge,
            code_challenge_method);

        startAuthentication(authorizationRequest);
} 
```

The first thing that `Authenticate()` does is prepare the OAuth Authorization request. This is the request sent to the jslib, and then to the JavaScript running in the browser. The player will be redirected to this URI in a browser popup.

[Authorization Code grant with PKCE](/blog/2019/08/22/okta-authjs-pkce) is the most secure and preferred OAuth grant to use. Historically, OAuth has required a client secret to be passed in the authorization request from the client. This design worked fine for back-end services that could securely store the client secret but is flawed in the case of SPA-type applications that do not have a back end. [Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) (PKCE) was created as a way to remove the need for the client secret altogether. A `code_verifier` is randomly generated by `Authenticate()` and then hashed with SHA-256 to create a `code_challenge`. The code challenge is what replaces the client secret and the code verifier is what will be used to validate the request for tokens after authentication.

Next, `Authenticate()` builds the authorization request URI with all of the required parameters - including the code challenge, a randomly generated state string, and a redirect uri pointing to the `callback.html` - and passes it to the jslib `startAuthentication()` function so that it can be passed to the browser for the popup to navigate to.

Once the popup is displayed, the user authenticates and is redirected back to the `callback.html` page with an OAuth `Auth Code` and exact copy of the `State` string that was included in the authorization request. The `callback.html` uses `window.opener.postMessage(code + "," + state, "*")` to send the `Auth Code` and `State` back to the parent page holding the WebGL object which triggers the event listener to call `unityInstance.SendMessage("OAuth2", "getAuthResults", data);`. `SendMessage()` needs to call a function in the OAuth2 class called `getAuthResults()`, which will process the authorization results and exchange the auth code for tokens. Add the following code to `OAuth.cs`:

```csharp
public void getAuthResults(string authResult)
{
        string[] s = authResult.Split(',');

        string code = s[0]; // Auth code from javascript
        string incoming_state = s[1]; //state from javascript

        Debug.Log(code);
        Debug.Log(state);

        if (incoming_state != state)
        {
                Debug.Log(String.Format("Received request with invalid state ({0})", incoming_state));
                return;
        }

        performCodeExchange(code, code_verifier, redirectURI);
}
```

This function simply receives the results from the authorization request and parses them. The next step is to exchange the `Auth Code` for an OAuth `Access Token` and `ID Token.`

```csharp
void performCodeExchange(string code, string code_verifier, string redirectURI)
{
        Debug.Log("Exchanging code for tokens...");

        //Generate token request
        string tokenRequestBody = string.Format("code={0}&redirect_uri={1}&client_id={2}&code_verifier={3}&scope=openid&grant_type=authorization_code",
            code,
            System.Uri.EscapeDataString(redirectURI),
            clientID,
            code_verifier);

        UnityWebRequest uwr = new UnityWebRequest(tokenEndpoint, "POST");
        var contentBytes = new UTF8Encoding().GetBytes(tokenRequestBody);
        uwr.uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(contentBytes);
        uwr.downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer();

        uwr.SetRequestHeader("content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");

        Debug.Log("TOKEN REQUEST BODY: " + tokenRequestBody);

        UnityWebRequestAsyncOperation async = uwr.SendWebRequest();
        async.completed += (AsyncOperation op) => { GetTokenExchangeResponse(async); };
}
```

A token request is created using the `auth code` and `code verifier`. `UnityWebRequest()` is used to handle the token request, and the response is sent to a function called `GetTokenExchangeResponse()` once complete. Create `GetTokenExchangeResponse()` by adding the following code:

```csharp
private void GetTokenExchangeResponse(UnityWebRequestAsyncOperation op)
{
        Debug.Log("Got Token Response");
        string responseText = op.webRequest.downloadHandler.text;
        Dictionary<string, string> tokenEndpointDecoded = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Dictionary<string, string>>(responseText);
        string access_token = tokenEndpointDecoded["access_token"];
        string idToken = tokenEndpointDecoded["id_token"];

        PlayFabInterface.Instance.LoginWithOpenIdConnect(idToken);
}
```

`GetTokenExchangeResponse()` simply parses the OAuth `Access Token` and OAuth `ID Token` from the response to the token request made by `performCodeExchange()`. The last line of the function sends the OAuth `ID Token` to `PlayFabInterface.Instance.LoginWithOpenIdConnect()` so that it can be used to log the player into PlayFab, which is the last step in this project before it can be deployed.

Finally, `Authenticate()` referenced a few helper functions for generating the code challenge\verifier, encryption, and encoding.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Returns URI-safe data with a given input length.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="length">Input length (nb. output will be longer)</param>
/// <returns></returns>
public static string randomDataBase64url(uint length)
{
        RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
        byte[] bytes = new byte[length];
        rng.GetBytes(bytes);
        return base64urlencodeNoPadding(bytes);
}

/// <summary>
/// Returns the SHA256 hash of the input string.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="inputString"></param>
/// <returns></returns>

## Log Into PlayFab

### Configure PlayFab OIDC

Before PlayFab can accept authorization tokens from Okta, a new [Open ID Connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/playfab/admin/authentication/createopenidconnection?view=playfab-rest) will need to be created. This is the connection that will give PlayFab the needed information to validate the player's ID Token.

Log into your PlayFab portal and click on the title for your project. If you do not have a `Studio` or `Title` created, create them now. The studio and title would have been needed for the PlayFab Unity SDK setup.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/12_PlayFabTitle.png alt:"PlayFab Title" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, click the gear next to the title name in the top left and select **Title Settings**.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/13_PlayFabGear.png alt:"PlayFab Gear" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click the `Open ID Connect` tab and select **New Connection**

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/14_PlayFaboidc.png alt:"PlayFab OIDC" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

In the `New Connection` menu, name the Connection ID `Okta` and enter the `Client ID` and `Issuer` from the app set up by the Okta CLI. `Client Secret` is not used because of `PKCE `, so enter any random string into the `Client Secret` box in PlayFab. Finally, PlayFab is just validating an ID Token from an external authorization server so nonce is not needed here. Check `Ignore nonce` and click **Save Connection**.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/15_PlayFabNewConnection.png alt:"PlayFab New Connection" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

PlayFab is now able to validate ID Tokens from the OAuth Authorization Server in Okta.

### Create the PlayFab Interface Script

Now that the player has successfully authenticated, the last step is to authorize the player to PlayFab using the ID token received after authentication.

In Unity, right click in the `Assets` > `Scripts` folder and select **Create**, **C# Script**. Name the script PlayFabInterface.cs and double click to open the script in Visual Studio.

Start the script with the following using statements:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using PlayFab;
using PlayFab.ClientModels;
```

Next, create a new class called `PlayFabInterface`:

```csharp
public class PlayFabInterface : MonoBehaviour
{
}
```

Create the `LoginWithOpenIdConnect()` function:

```csharp
public void LoginWithOpenIdConnect(string _idToken)
{
        Debug.LogError("LoginWithOpenIDConnect Start! Token: " + _idToken);
        var request = new LoginWithOpenIdConnectRequest();
        request.ConnectionId = "Okta";
        request.IdToken = _idToken;
        request.CreateAccount = true;

        PlayFabClientAPI.LoginWithOpenIdConnect(request, OIDCLoginSuccess, OIDCLoginFailure, _idToken);
}
```

Finally, handle the results:

```csharp
public void OIDCLoginSuccess(LoginResult _result)
{
        Debug.Log("Login With OIDC Success");
}

public void OIDCLoginFailure(PlayFabError _error)
{
        Debug.LogError("Login With OIDC Failure");
        Debug.LogError(_error.GenerateErrorReport());
}
```

The user will now log into PlayFab using their ID Token from the OAuth Authorization Server in Okta.

## Wire It Up

Now that the authentication logic exists, it just needs to be triggered. The `Sign In` button created earlier will need to call the `Authenticate()` function from its on-click event. The `OAuth.cs` and `PlayFabInterface.cs` scripts will also need to be added to a game object in the scene.

In Unity, right-click in the scene `Hierarchy` panel and then click **Create Empty**. Rename the game object to `OAuth.`

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/p_createEmpty.png alt:"Create Empty" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Drag the `OAuth.cs` and `PlayFabInterface.cs` scripts from the `Scripts` folder and onto the empty game object in the `Hierarchy` panel.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/p_addScripts.png alt:"Add Scripts" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

In the `Hierarchy` panel, expand the `Canvas` object holding your `Sign In` button, and then select the `Sign In` button.

In the `Inspector` panel, find the `On Click()` box and drag the `OAuth` game object onto it. Select the function dropdown, click **OAuth2**, and then click **Authenticate()**.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/p_onClick.png alt:"On Click" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

The button will now call the `Authenticate()` function in OAuth.cs when the player clicks it.

## Deploy to Azure App Services

Because of the jslib and browser code's complexity, this project cannot be run from the editor directly. [Azure App Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/) makes the deployment of the entire project easy.

First, back up your `index.html` and `callback.html` files.

In Unity, click **File**, **Build Settings** and then click **Build** to rebuild the project. Select the desired output folder and click **Select Folder**.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/9_build.png alt:"Build" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Navigate to the output folder selected and overwrite the `index.html` and `callback.html` files with the ones you backed up previously.

Open a preferred text editor, create a new file in the output folder called `web.config`, and add the following:

```xml
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <staticContent>
      <mimeMap fileExtension=".unityweb" mimeType ="TYPE/SUBTYPE" />
    </staticContent>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

This web config file will make sure that the WebGL object is properly loaded when hosted.

Next, open Visual Studio and click **Continue without code** from the startup wizard.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/16_VisualStudio.png alt:"Visual Studio" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click **File**, **Open**, **Web Site** and select the output folder where the `index.html` and `callback.html` are located.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/17_OpenWebSite.png alt:"Open Website" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, click **Build**, **Publish Web App**, and then click **Start** on the `Publish` tab. Select `Azure` and click **Next**.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/18_VSPublish1.png alt:"Publish1" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Select `Azure App Service` and click **Next**.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/19_VSPublish2.png alt:"Publish2" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click **Create New Azure App Service**.

Give the app the name used when setting up the `RedirectURI` in the Okta CLI where the placeholder was `appName.` This example used `https://webgloauth.azurewebsites.net/`, so the app name to use in Azure is `WebGLOAuth.`

Select a valid subscription, click **New** to create a new resource group, click **New** to create a new hosting plan, and then click **Create**.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/20_VSPublish3.png alt:"Publish3" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

With the new app selected in the publish menu, click **Finish**.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/p_VSPublishFinish.png alt:"Publish4" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

> Note: Before clicking `Publish,` make sure that the `Site URL` in the `Summary` section matches the DNS that was defined in the Okta CLI during the app setup for the callback URI. This example used `https://webgloauth.azurewebsites.net/` and `https://webgloauth.azurewebsites.net/callback.html` which matches the `Site URL` in Visual Studio. This same callback URI also needs to be correctly defined in the instance variables in the `OAuth.cs` script in Unity.

Finally, click **Publish** to deploy the application to Azure App Services.

{% img blog/unity-webgl-playfab-authorization/21_VSPublish4.png alt:"Publish5" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Once publishing is complete, click the `Site URL` to navigate to the application and test it out.

## Conclusion

Player security is quickly becoming one of the most critical aspects of game development today. More development is being done in the cloud, and more player data is being collected than ever before. While best practice for authentication and authorization is to use OAuth and a trusted security platform's hosted login experience, the design to do this changes from one target platform to another. For Unity WebGL, you were able to interact with the WebGL's parent page to render a popup that facilitated user authentication via your trusted cloud security platform, Okta. The resulting auth code was exchanged for tokens that can authorize the player to backend cloud platforms that your project is using; in this case, Azure PlayFab. Finally, you were able to host the project entirely on Azure App Services. The OAuth tokens used with PlayFab can authorize the user to other backend cloud platforms as needed, allowing for a convenient, centralized security design. The method used to facilitate browser interaction for WebGL will change with other target platforms, but the rest of the design would continue to be similar across all platforms.
