User account management, authorization, and access control can be difficult to implement for many web developers. At the same time, they are critical cornerstones of application security – any mistake can lead to data leaks, financial losses, and legal troubles.

Successful web applications inevitably grow to a stage where simple user authorization is no longer sufficient and certain features have to be made available only to certain users. There are a variety of ways to achieve this, usually via some combination of access-control lists that limit access to the system based on the user's role, group assignments, or even individual permissions. Depending on your choice of programming language/framework, you will likely have multiple implementation options for authorization available out-of-the-box.

No matter what framework you select (including none at all) though, third-party identity management providers like [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/product/user-management/) offer a fast, secure, and simple option based on industry standards.  Okta is an API service that allows you to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or more applications. It solves all of the problems associated with user account management and lets you concentrate on what really matters – providing useful features to your customers.

I previously showed you how to [build simple login in PHP](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/12/28/simple-login-php) using just core PHP with a single dependency on an external library. In that initial version, our simple application allowed users to register, log in, and reset their passwords. Today, we'll build upon this foundation and add group and role-based authorization. 

<div markdown="1" style="border: 1px #eedeaa solid; background: #ffffee; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
**Prerequisites:** Please ensure you have already installed PHP, Composer, and have signed up for a [free Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).
</div>

## Set Up a Simple PHP App and Add Okta

Before you start, clone the original project from [https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-php-core-login-example](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-php-core-login-example) and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oktadeveloper/okta-php-core-login-example.git
cd okta-php-core-login-example
composer install
cp .env.example .env
```

If you don't have a free Okta developer account yet, [create one now](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) and log in.


Go to the **Applications** menu item and click the **Add Application** button:
  
{% img blog/php-group-role-authorization/image2.png alt:"Add Application button" width:"300" %}{: .center-image }

Select **Web** and click **Next**.
  
{% img blog/php-group-role-authorization/image7.png alt:"Select Web from the list of application types" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Enter a title, and set `http://localhost:8080/` as both the Base URI and Login Redirect URI, then click Done. You can leave the rest of the settings as they are:

{% img blog/php-group-role-authorization/image1.png alt:"Application settings" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from the application settings, then go to **API** > **Tokens**, and click **Create Token**:

{% img blog/php-group-role-authorization/image5.png alt:"Select tokens from the dropdown menu under API" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Enter a title for your token, copy the value of the token, and store it safely. You will only be able to see it once - if you lose it, you'll need to create a new token. Also, take note of your main organization URL (it looks like https://{yourOktaDomain}) - you will need this as well.

Go back to your application directory, edit the `.env` file and fill in your Okta details like this:

```
CLIENT_ID=<Your Client ID from the Application settings>
CLIENT_SECRET=<Your Client Secret from the Application settings>
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/
METADATA_URL=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
API_URL_BASE=https://{yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/
API_TOKEN=<the value of the token you created>
```

Run the PHP built-in web server:

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t public
```

When you load `http://localhost:8080`, you should see the app:

{% img blog/php-group-role-authorization/image6.png alt:"Not logged in" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Test the application by logging in with your Okta account. You can also use the **Register** link to create a new account, and the **Forgot password** link to reset the password of an existing account. Verify that all features are working before proceeding further. Once you create new accounts, you'll see them in your Okta account.

Finally, make sure to test the **Log Out** link as well. Note that when you log out, the application destroys the local session but you remain logged in your Okta account. If you click **Log In** again, you'll be logged in without entering your password (unless you manually log out of your Okta account as well). This is the recommended behavior since the Okta account might be currently used in other applications as well – you don't want to destroy the user's session everywhere (although you can do it via the Okta API)!

## Understand Roles and Groups-Based Authorization

It's time to add group and role-based authorization to the application. But before you do that, let me explain the difference between roles and groups in Okta.

Your Okta organization can include multiple users. Okta can also provide identity management services for multiple applications. If you want to limit the access of users to certain applications, you can do it manually, user by user, but this won't scale very well. It's much easier to manage your users if you create groups and assign users to them. Then you can assign the groups to individual applications. You can also import users from an external application or directory into an Okta group.

You can learn more about users and groups in the [Okta documentation](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Directory/eug-overview.htm).

Roles, on the other hand, mainly define what your users can do within Okta (although you can still use roles to control the permissions of users in external apps). Some of your Okta users have permissions to access the Okta administrative dashboard. When you give Administrator access to a user, it overrides the user's group settings. The role types are pre-defined in Okta and you can read more about them here:
[Okta administrators](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/Administrators.htm)

You can gain access to a user's groups and roles via the Okta API:

* [Okta Roles API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/roles/)
* [Okta Groups API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/groups/)

### Create an Admin Group and Users in Okta

If you've already set up and tested the base application, you should have some users in your organization. If you don't have additional users yet, register some test accounts now! When ready, go ahead and create an 'Admin' group in Okta:

Go to **Users** > **Groups** in the menu. You should see a screen like this:

{% img blog/php-group-role-authorization/image4.png alt:"Groups menu in the Okta dashboard" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click **Add Group**. Enter "Admin" as the group name, and "Application Admins" as the description:

{% img blog/php-group-role-authorization/image8.png alt:"The add group dialog in the Okta dashboard" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

After creating the group, click on the group name, then click **Add Members**, and associate one or two of your existing users to the admin group.

## Retrieve the User Roles and Groups in Your PHP APP

In this section, you'll modify the base application code so it will retrieve and display the user's roles and groups upon login.

Modify `src/services/OktaApiService.php`. At the end of the `authorizeUser()` function, find the following code which verifies the token at the introspection endpoint and if it's OK, sets the username of the logged in user:

```php
        if ($token->active == 1) {
            $_SESSION['username'] = $token->username;
            $result['success'] = true;
            return $result;
        }
```

Modify the code like this, deleting the existing `findUser()` method from the class and add the following new methods below `authorizeUser()` (note that we're also adding a refactored version of `findUser()` so the existing code won't break):

```php
    ...
    if ($token->active == 1) {
        $_SESSION['username'] = $token->username;
        $this->fillUserDetails($token->username);
        $result['success'] = true;
        return $result;
    }
    ...

    private function fillUserDetails($username)
    {
        $userData = json_decode($this->findUser(['email' => $username]), true);
        $userId = $userData[0]['id'];

        $userGroups = json_decode($this->getUserGroups($userId), true);
        $groupList = [];
        foreach($userGroups as $group) {
            $groupList[$group['id']] = $group['profile']['name'];
        }

        $userRoles = json_decode($this->getUserRoles($userId), true);
        $roleList = [];
        foreach($userRoles as $role) {
            $roleList[$role['id']] = $role['type'];
        }

        $_SESSION['username'] = $username;
        $_SESSION['id'] = $userId;
        $_SESSION['groups'] = $groupList;
        $_SESSION['roles'] = $roleList;
    }

    public function findUser($input)
    {
        $url = $this->apiUrlBase . 'users?q=' . urlencode($input['email']) . '&limit=1';
        return $this->oktaApiGet($url);
    }

    private function getUserGroups($userId)
    {
        $url = $this->apiUrlBase . 'users/' . $userId . '/groups';
        return $this->oktaApiGet($url);
    }

    private function getUserRoles($userId)
    {
        $url = $this->apiUrlBase . 'users/' . $userId . '/roles';
        return $this->oktaApiGet($url);
    }

    private function oktaApiGet($url)
    {
        $ch = curl_init($url);
        curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
        curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
            'Accept: application/json',
            'Content-Type: application/json',
            'Authorization: SSWS ' . $this->apiToken
        ]);
        return curl_exec($ch);
    }
```

Modify `/src/views/header.php` to display the user's roles and groups on the dashboard after logging in. Find the following part of the code:

```php
<p>
    Logged in as <?php echo $_SESSION['username'] ?>
</p>
<p><a href="/?logout">Log Out</a></p>
```

Replace it with:

```php
<p>
    Logged in as <?php echo $_SESSION['username'] ?> (id: <?php echo $_SESSION['id'];?>)
</p>
<p>
    Groups: <?php
        foreach($_SESSION['groups'] as $id => $name) {
            echo "<br>". $name;
        }
    ?>
</p>
<p>
    Roles: <?php
        foreach($_SESSION['roles'] as $id => $name) {
            echo "<br>". $name;
        }
    ?>
</p>
<p><a href="/?super">Super Admin Only</a> | <a href="/?admin">Admins</a> | <a href="/?logout">Log Out</a></p>
```

If you reload the application now (and login if necessary), you should see your user's roles and groups:

{% img blog/php-group-role-authorization/image3.png alt:"The application in the logged-in state" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Login with different user accounts, including accounts that are members of the 'Admin' group and your main Okta account (which will have the `SUPER_ADMIN` role) to see how the groups and roles will change.

## Add Protected Routes and Check User Permissions in PHP

If you paid attention, you've noticed that the menu includes two new items: 'Super Admin only' and 'Admins'. Let's implement the handlers for these routes and make sure the first one is accessible only to accounts with the 'SUPER_ADMIN' role, and the second one is only for members of the 'Admin' group.

Add the following code to `public/index.php` below the `password_reset` handler:

```php
if (isset($_REQUEST['super'])) {
    if (isset($_SESSION['roles']) && in_array('SUPER_ADMIN', $_SESSION['roles'])) {
        echo 'You can access this page!';
    } else {
        echo 'Super Admins only!';
    }
    die();
}


if (isset($_REQUEST['admin'])) {
    if (isset($_SESSION['roles']) && in_array('Admin', $_SESSION['groups'])) {
        echo 'You can access this page!';
    } else {
        echo 'Admins only!';
    }
    die();
}
```

Try clicking the links when you're logged in with different user accounts and you'll see how the message changes depending on your role and group.

You should now have a basic understanding of how you can configure groups and roles in your Okta dashboard to control who can access different parts of an application!
