Getting something to work is one of the greatest feelings you can have as a developer. Especially when you've spent hours, days, or months trying to make it happen. The last mile can be one of the most painful and rewarding experiences, all wrapped into the same day or two.

I experienced this recently with link:/blog/2022/03/03/spring-native-jhipster[Spring Native for JHipster]. If I look back, it took a year's worth of desire, research, and perseverance to make it happen. When we finally got it working&mdash;and automated&mdash;you can imagine my excitement!

After a few days of euphoria, I thought it'd be easy to create native builds for each operating system (Linux, macOS, and Windows) using GitHub Actions. I was wrong.

If you'd like to follow along and learn how to configure GitHub Actions to create native binaries, you'll need a few prerequisites.

*Prerequisites*:

- https://sdkman.io[Java 11]+
- https://nodejs.org[Node 16]
- A https://github.com/signup[GitHub Account]

You can read the full conversation (aka a condensed version of this post) via the tweet below, or keep reading to walk through the trials and tribulations I experienced with GitHub Actions and GraalVM. Hopefully, my learnings will save you hours of time.

== Configure a JHipster app to use GitHub Actions

I'm going to speed things up for you and just show you how to configure GitHub Actions for an existing JHipster app. In this case, it's a full-stack React + Spring Boot app.

====
If you'd like a bit more background, please read https://auth0.com/blog/full-stack-java-with-react-spring-boot-and-jhipster/[Full Stack Java with React, Spring Boot, and JHipster] followed by link:/blog/2022/03/03/spring-native-jhipster[Introducing Spring Native for JHipster].
====

Clone the result of these two blog posts, right after I integrated the JHipster Native blueprint. Install its dependencies using npm.

// todo: If you update the jhipster-native branch, make sure to remove .github/workflows

[source,shell]
----
git clone -b jhipster-native-1.1.2 \
  https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git flickr2
cd flickr2
npm install
----

Then, create a https://github.com/new[new repo on GitHub]. For example, `jhipster-flickr2`.

Next, push this example project to it.

[source,shell]
----
USERNAME=<your-github-username>
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:${USERNAME}/jhipster-flickr2.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
----

== Automate the wait with JHipster's CI/CD

Building native images with GraalVM brings me back to the days when we'd build Java apps with Ant and XDoclet in the early 2000s. We'd start the build and go do something else for a while because it took _several minutes_ for the artifact to be built.

Another often-overlooked issue with native binaries is that you have to build one for each operating system. It's not like Java, where you can build a JAR (Java ARchive) and run it anywhere.

Next, generate continuous integration (CI) workflows using https://www.jhipster.tech/setting-up-ci/[JHipster's CI/CD sub-generator].

[source,shell]
----
npx jhipster ci-cd
----

This command will prompt you to select a CI/CD pipeline. Select **GitHub Actions**.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/github-actions-graalvm/jhipster-ci-cd.png' %}[alt=Welcome to the JHipster CI/CD Sub-Generator,width=800, align=center]

When prompted for the tasks/integrations for this quick example (Sonar, Docker, Snyk, Heroku, and Cypress Dashboard), don't select any. The sub-generator will create three files:

- `.github/workflows/main.yml`
- `.github/workflows/native.yml`
- `.github/workflows/native-artifact.yml`

I'll show you what each file contains in the sections below. Let's start by examining `main.yml`.

The `main.yml` workflow file configures GitHub Actions to check out your project, configure Node 16, configure Java 11, run your project's backend/frontend unit tests, and run its end-to-end tests. Not only that, it'll start your dependent containers (e.g., Keycloak) in Docker. You can see that most of this functionality is hidden behind `npm run` commands.

git checkout -b actions
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions"

If you watch the tests run from your PR, you'll be pretty pleased until it hits the **E2E: Package** phase. It'll likely fail with the following error:

[source,shell]

----

I https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/18387[reported this issue in JHipster] since `--remove-orphans` was recently removed from the `docker:db:down` and `docker:keycloak:down` commands. The explanation provided enough information for me to close the issue. Add them back into `package.json` as a workaround.

Commit and push these changes. Now everything should pass.

== The environmental impact of GraalVM builds

This brings us to an interesting dilemma. If you're creating native images as your application's distribution artifact, shouldn't you use the https://github.com/graalvm/setup-graalvm/issues/6[setup-graalvm action] to configure GraalVM and your Java SDK?

I don't think so. If you do, every time you create a PR and commit to it, it will run a native build. A GraalVM build of this project takes 3-4 minutes for me locally. With GitHub Actions, it takes 30+ minutes!

To me, this seems as bad for the environment as cryptocurrency. If you're using a private repo, it'll also make you wish you bought crypto several years ago. You only get 2000 free minutes of GitHub Actions for private repos. Any minutes after that, you get charged for.

_Yes, I know the cryptocurrency topic is controversial. I do like to poke fun at it though. Native builds on every commit and mining bitcoin seem similar to me. Then again, https://www.fastcompany.com/90717181/surfing-the-web-isnt-just-bad-for-your-brain-its-terrible-for-the-environment[simply surfing the web] is terrible for the environment too._

== Best Practices for GraalVM with GitHub Actions

When I first started investigating GitHub Actions for GraalVM, the JHipster Native blueprint modified commands in `package.json` to always build native images and to use them when running end-to-end tests. This meant that when you first tried to add GitHub Actions support, the build would fail because `GRAALVM_HOME` wasn't found. To solve this, you could switch from `actions/setup-java` to `graalvm/setup-graalvm`, but that's not very environmentally sustainable.

Since then, we've modified the blueprint to generate two new workflows that reflect (in my opinion) best practices for GitHub Actions and GraalVM.

1. `native.yml`: run nightly tests at midnight using GraalVM
2. `native-artifact.yml`: builds and uploads native binaries for releases

The `main.yml` stays the same as JHipster's default and continuously tests on the JVM.

== Run nightly tests with GraalVM and GitHub Actions

The `native.yml` workflow file performs similar actions to `main.yml`, but with GraalVM. It runs on a schedule every day at midnight UTC. Adding a timezone is https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/13454[currently not supported].

If you compare `native.yml` with `main.yml`, you'll see it doesn't run unit tests (because Spring Native doesn't support Mockito yet). It does build a native executable and runs end-to-end tests against it.

If you wait until after midnight UTC, you can view this workflow's results in your repo's *Actions* tab. It also has a `workflow_dispatch` event trigger, so you can trigger it manually from your browser.

NOTE: The end-to-end tests are currently disabled for Windows because https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-native/pull/43#issuecomment-1105971295[Docker images fail to start].

== How to build and upload native binaries when releasing on GitHub

The `native-artifact.yml` workflow file creates binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows when a release is created. This workflow configures Linux and Windows to have enough memory, uploads artifacts to the actions job, and uploads the native binaries to the release on GitHub. It will only execute when you create a release (aka a tag).

=== Linux and Windows problems and solutions

When I first started trying to build native binaries with GraalVM, I quickly ran into https://github.com/graalvm/setup-graalvm/issues/6[issues] on Linux and Windows:

- Linux: `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded`
- Windows: `The command line is too long.`

I'm happy to say that I was able to fix the OOM error on Linux by specifying `-J-Xmx10g` in the build arguments of the `native-maven-plugin` plugin. JHipster Native now configures this setting by default and optimizes it for your OS when building native artifacts.

[source,xml]
----
<native-image-name>native-executable</native-image-name>
<native-build-args>--verbose -J-Xmx10g</native-build-args>

            <buildArg>--no-fallback ${native-build-args}</buildArg>
        </buildArgs>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

The Windows issue was fixed by https://github.com/graalvm/setup-graalvm/issues/6#issuecomment-1054582083[native build tools 0.9.10].

We use `windows-2019` instead of `windows-latest` because I https://github.com/graalvm/setup-graalvm/issues/6#issuecomment-1058328963[ran out of disk space] when I tried it.

=== Publish a release on GitHub

Open your repository's page in your favorite browser and click *Create a new release*. Create a new `v0.0.1` tag, title the release `v0.0.1`, and add some fun text in the description. Click **Publish release**.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/github-actions-graalvm/release.png' %}[alt=Restore v0.0.1 - Giddyup!,width=800, align=center]

Click the **Actions** tab to watch your release execute. I want to warn you though, it's gonna take a while! My https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1498471457638293507[first successful release] took just under an hour.

- macOS: 31m 30s
- Linux: 33m 50s
- Windows: 59m 45s

I think you'll be pleased with the results. ü§†

image::{% asset_path 'blog/github-actions-graalvm/release-with-artifacts.png' %}[alt=Released with native binaries attached,width=800,align=center]

TIP: If your builds fail, you can delete the tag for the release by running `git push origin :v0.0.1`. Your release will then become a draft, and you can easily create the release again using the GitHub UI.

== Run your released binaries locally

If you were to download these binaries from GitHub and try to run them locally, you'd get failures because they can't connect to instances of Keycloak or PostgreSQL.

To start up a PostgreSQL database for the app to talk to, you can run the following command from your `flickr2` directory.

[source,shell]

docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d

You could do the same for Keycloak:

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
----

Or, configure the app to use link:/blog/2022/03/03/spring-native-jhipster#use-okta-as-your-identity-provider[Okta] or link:/blog/2022/03/03/spring-native-jhipster#use-auth0-as-your-identity-provider[Auth0]!

The Okta CLI makes it so easy, you can do it in minutes.

{% include setup/cli.md type="jhipster" %}

Then, start the app by setting the environment variables from `.okta.env` and executing the binary. For example:

[source,shell]
----
source .okta.env
chmod +x flickr2-macOS-v0.0.1-x86_64
./flickr2-macOS-v0.0.1-x86_64
# verify in System Preferences > Security & Privacy and run again
----

TIP: If you're on Windows, you may need to install the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about[Windows Subsystem for Linux] for these commands to succeed. Or, you can rename `.okta.env` to `okta.bat` and change `export` to `set` in the file. Then, run it from your terminal to set the variables.

Everything should work as expected. Pretty slick, don't you think?

I hope you've enjoyed this tour of how to configure GitHub Actions to create GraalVM binaries of Java applications. Native binaries start quite a bit faster than JARs, but they take a lot longer to build. That's why it's a good idea to farm out those processes to a continuous integration server.
