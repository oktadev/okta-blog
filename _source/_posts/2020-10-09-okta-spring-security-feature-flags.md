Okta is an Identity and Access Management platform. The TL;DR: you offload the responsibility for secure authentication and authorization to Okta so you can focus on the business logic of the app you're building.

Okta and Spring Boot already go together like peanut butter and chocolate. Add in feature flags care of [Split](https://split.io), and you can test new capabilities for your app without having to redeploy. That's testing in production the smart way! And, you can leverage Okta's groups to easily manage who should see the new stuff and who sees the old stuff.

In this post, I start with setting up an Okta org and configuring an OpenID Connect app. Next, I integrate Okta into a simple Spring Boot and Spring Security app. Finally, I add feature flags to deliver a new UI experience for select users - those that belong to a particular group.

## Get Started with Okta

OpenID Connect (OIDC) rides on top of OAuth 2.0 for a modern Single Sign-on, authentication and authorization standard. Okta provides these standards as a service. Don't know anything about these standards yet? Good news - You don't have to! By following some simple instructions to provision an Okta org and setup a hosted instance of OIDC, you can easily integrate a Spring Boot app with just configuration. Let's get started with 3 easy steps:

> If you're interested in learning more about OIDC and OAuth 2.0, [here](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/07/25/oidc-primer-part-1) and [here](https://oauth.com) are good places to start. Look for more links to posts on OIDC and OAuth 2.0 at the end of this post.

### Register for an Okta Org and Create an OIDC App

{% include setup/cli.md type="web" loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta" logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080" %}

#### Add Users to your Okta Org

Run `okta login` and open the resulting URL in your browser. Sign in to the Okta Admin Console.

Then, go to **Directory** > **People**. Here, you'll see the user already created for you with the name and email you submitted to create the Okta org.

Click **Add Person**. This will bring you to the input form for adding a new user:

{% img blog/okta-split-spring-security/new-user.png alt:"New User" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Change the **Password** field to **Set by admin** and uncheck **User must change password on first login**. Create the following users by filling out the form and clicking on **Save and Add Another** for each:

| First name | Last name | Username           | Primary email      | Password  |
|------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Bob        | Belcher   | bob@belcher.com    | bob@belcher.com    | 123456aA$ |
| Linda      | Belcher   | linda@belcher.com  | linda@belcher.com  | 123456aA$ |
| Tina       | Belcher   | tina@belcher.com   | tina@belcher.com   | 123456aA$ |
| Gene       | Belcher   | gene@belcher.com   | gene@belcher.com   | 123456aA$ |
| Louise     | Belcher   | louise@belcher.com | louise@belcher.com | 123456aA$ |

Next, you'll add some groups and assign some users to those groups.

#### Add Groups to your Okta Org

Navigate to **Directory** > **Groups**. Here, you'll see the built-in `Everyone` group. As you might imagine, every current and new user is automatically added to this group.

Click **Add Group**. This will bring you to the input form for adding a new group:

{% img blog/okta-split-spring-security/new-group.png alt:"New User" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Enter **BETA_TESTER** in both the **Name** and **Group Description** fields. Click **Add Group**.

Click the link to the newly created **BETA_TESTER** group. Click **Manage People**. Click on each of **Tina**, **Gene**, and **Louise** on the left. Notice that those users are moved from the left to the right, indicating that they will be members of the group. Click **Save** to finalize these changes.

Now, you're Okta org is configured with five users (the Belcher family), 3 of whom belong to the **BETA_TESTER** group.


### Configure the OIDC App to Return Groups Claim

The last Okta configuration step is to make sure that the list of groups a user belongs to is returned when a user authenticates. You'll see below that this integrates very easily with Spring Security.

Go to **Security** > **API** and select the **default** authorization server (it should be the only one right now).

Click the **Claims** tab. Click **Add Claim**:

{% img blog/okta-split-spring-security/groups-claim.png alt:"Groups" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Fill the form in with the following (leave anything not named as default):

| Field                 | value            |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| Name                  | groups           |
| Include in token type | ID Token Always  |
| Value type            | Groups           |
| Filter                | Matches regex .* |

Click **Create** to finish.

Your Okta org is all ready to go to provide authentication and authorization services to your application. This is the great thing about Okta - with a little bit of configuration, you get all the services you need for auth allowing you to focus on the primary mission of your app.

> All of the configuration you did in this section can be done via the Okta Management API. If this is something that interests you, check out the documentation [here](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/).

Next up, you'll wire up Spring Boot with Spring Security to your Okta org. When you see how easy it is, your mind might just get blown.

## Get Started with Spring Boot

The Spring team over at Pivotal has done an amazing job of making getting started with Spring Boot super easy. The Spring Initializr project over at [https://start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) allows you to select everything you need for the app you want to build.

For our purposes (and to keep things simple), you just need:

| Component  | Description                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Spring Web | RESTful APIs and Spring MVC                          |
| Thymeleaf  | Server-side Java templating engine                   |
| Okta       | Easy integration with Okta; includes Spring Security |

{% img blog/okta-split-spring-security/spring-initializr.png alt:"Initializr" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Spring Initializr even makes it easy to load a pre-configured project from a [direct link](https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.3.4.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=com.okta.examples&artifactId=okta-split-example&name=okta-split-example&description=Feature%20Flags%20with%20Okta%2C%20Split%20and%20Spring%20Security&packageName=com.okta.examples.okta_split_example&dependencies=web,thymeleaf,okta).

And, you can download the project from the command line with:

```bash
curl -G \
--data 'type=maven-project' \
--data 'language=java' \
--data 'bootVersion=2.3.4.RELEASE' \
--data 'baseDir=okta-split-example' \
--data 'groupId=com.okta.examples' \
--data 'artifactId=okta-split-example' \
--data 'name=okta-split-example' \
--data 'packageName=com.okta.examples.okta_split_example' \
--data 'packaging=jar' \
--data 'javaVersion=11' \
--data 'dependencies=web,thymeleaf,okta' \
--data-urlencode 'description=Feature Flags with Okta, Split and Spring Security' \
https://start.spring.io/starter.zip  \
-o okta-split-example.zip
```

Expand the downloaded zip archive and open it in the IDE of your choice.

You can also find the completed application over on the [Okta Developer GitHub repo](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-split-example).

### Integrate with Okta

In order for this Spring Boot app to connect to your Okta org you need to rename `src/main/resources/application.properties` to `src/main/resources/application.yml`, and just set the three configuration parameters you got before when creating the OIDC app with the Okta CLI:

```yaml
okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: <yourOktaDomain>/oauth2/default
    clientId: <oidc client id>
    clientSecret: <oidc client secret>
```

At this point, the Spring Boot app is ready to run! Execute:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080`. You should immediately be redirected to Okta to authenticate. After authenticating, you should end up with a `404` error, as you haven't added any content to your app yet. You'll do that next.

### Create a Basic Thymeleaf Template

The last two pieces that are needed for a basic Model-View-Controller (MVC) app are a controller and a view in Spring Boot.

#### Create a Controller

Add a file called `HomeController` with the following:

```java
@Controller
public class HomeController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("username", user.getPreferredUsername());
        model.addAttribute("roles", user.getAuthorities());
        return "home";
    }
}
```

Using the `@AuthenticationPrincipal` annotation, the authenticated `OidcUser` is autowired into the home method. A `Model` object is passed into the method as well.

The `Model` object is updated with the authenticated user's username and a list of the Spring Security authorities associated with that user.

Since the project is configured with the Thymeleaf templating engine, returning a `String` at the end of the controller method will automatically return a template with that name. In this case, Thymeleaf will look for a template named: `home.html`.

#### Create a View

Create a file called: `src/main/resources/templates/home/html` with the following:

```html
<html xmlns:th="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <h2>
            <span th:inline="text">Hello, [[${username}]]!</span>
        </h2>
        <p/>
        Here are your roles:
        <br/>
        <ul th:each="role : ${roles}">
            <li th:inline="text">[[${role}]]</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```

This template displays the `username` from the model. It then uses the Thymeleaf construct `th:each` to iterate over the list of `roles` from the model.

Restart the application, navigate once again to `http://localhost:8080` and login as: `tina@belcher.com`.

Amongst a number of default roles and scopes, you should see that she has the `BETA_TESTER` role.

{% img blog/okta-split-spring-security/home-template.png alt:"Groups" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

At this point, the Spring Boot + Spring Security application is fully functional (such as it is).

Next, I talk about feature flags with Split and then I bring Spring and Split together.

## Get Started with Feature Flags

Split is a platform for combining feature flags and experiments with data, giving you more confidence in releases of your app.

In the example for this post, you integrate a split **treatment** such that a select group of users sees a new 'beta' interface for your app while ordinary users see the current production interface.

When our imaginary beta testing is complete, you can enable the new interface for all users.

Best of all, you could repeat this process, creating new beta experiences to be tested by your group and eventually making that generally available.

Getting setup with a free developer account for Split is as easy as 1, 2, 3:

1. Go to: <https://split.io>, click: Free Account
2. Fill out the registration form and click: CREATE FREE ACCOUNT
3. Follow the link you receive in email and set a password.

{% img blog/okta-split-spring-security/split.png alt:"split" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

### Create the Treatment in Split

Treatments allow you to define settings and behaviors for what you want to test. For my example, we want to setup a treatment that will return **on** or **off** depending on whether or not you are part of the beta tester group.

To start, click **DE** in the upper left. Choose **Admin Settings** and **API Keys**. Copy the value for **sdk** Type in the **prod-default** Environment. You'll need this in the Spring Boot app shortly.

{% img blog/okta-split-spring-security/split-api-key.png alt:"split api key" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

> NOTE: If you're new to using Split and/or on the free tier, the button in the upper left will say `DE` for **default**. If you've set up multiple workspaces, then the button will be labeled with the first two letters of the workspace name.

Next, Click **Splits** on the left-hand side and click **Create Split**. Give it a **Name**. Leave the other defaults and click **Create**.

{% img blog/okta-split-spring-security/split-treatment-create.png alt:"split treatment create" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Next, click **Add Rules** on the **Targeting Rules** tab. Split automatically adds **on** and **off** treatment definitions and sets **off** as the default.

For the use-case in this example, we want to add a group for which the treatment will return a value of **on**.

Click **Add Rule** in the **Set Targeting Rules** section. Here, we want to have the treatment return **on** if the user is in the group of beta testers. To accomplish this, enter **groups** in the **Add attribute** field. From the **Select matcher** dropdown, choose **Set > has any of** and enter **BETA_TESTER** in the field. Change the **serve** dropdown to **on**.

{% img blog/okta-split-spring-security/split-targetting-rules.png alt:"split targetting rules" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

This now makes it read like an english sentence: "If the user has an attribute called groups and the groups list contains the value BETA_TESTER, then serve 'on' for the treatment"

Click **Save Changes**.

Click **Confirm** on the summary screen.

### Integrate the Treatment with Spring Security

Edit the `pom.xml` file in the project. Add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.split.client</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

> You can get the complete application, including the integration with Split over at the [Okta Developer GitHub repo](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-split-example).

This brings the Split Java SDK into scope for the project.

Next, add a configuration to the project to make the Split Java Client available to the application. Here's `SplitConfig.java`:

```java
@Configuration
public class SplitConfig {

    @Value("#{ @environment['split.api-key'] }")
    private String splitApiKey;

    @Bean
    public SplitClient splitClient() throws Exception {
        SplitClientConfig config = SplitClientConfig.builder()
            .setBlockUntilReadyTimeout(1000)
            .enableDebug()
            .build();

        SplitFactory splitFactory = SplitFactoryBuilder.build(splitApiKey, config);
        SplitClient client = splitFactory.client();
        client.blockUntilReady();

        return client;
    }
}
```

Add the following to the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file:

```yaml
split:
  api-key: <your Split API Key>
```

> Notice that it's using the `@Value` annotation to pull in the Split API Key from the environment. This is a best practice. You should never hardcode an API Key into an application nor commit it in a git repo. In this case, `application.yml` is listed in the `.gitignore` file to ensure it's not added to the git repo.

This is the key line that sets up the Split Client for use elsewhere in the code:

```java
SplitFactory splitFactory = SplitFactoryBuilder.build(splitApiKey, config);
```

Let's set up a new template called `home-beta.html` (It's mostly copypasta from the original template and should be located in: `src/main/resources/templates`):

```html
<html xmlns:th="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <h1>WELCOME TO THE BETA EXPERIENCE</h1>
        <h2>
            <span th:inline="text">Hello, [[${username}]]!</span>
        </h2>
        <p/>
        Here are your roles:
        <br/>
        <ul th:each="role : ${roles}">
            <li th:inline="text">[[${role}]]</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```

The last piece of the puzzle is in the `HomeController`. I want to have the app render the new `home-beta` template if the authenticated user is in the `BETA_TESTER` group. Here's the updated controller:

```java
@Controller
public class HomeController {

    SplitClient splitClient;

    public HomeController(SplitClient splitClient) {
        this.splitClient = splitClient;
    }

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("username", user.getPreferredUsername());
        model.addAttribute("roles", user.getAuthorities());

        List<String> groups =  user.getAuthorities().stream()
            .map(GrantedAuthority::getAuthority).collect(Collectors.toList());

        String inBeta = splitClient.getTreatment(
            user.getPreferredUsername(),
            "BETA_UI_EXPERIENCE",
            Map.of("groups", groups)
        );

        return "on".equals(inBeta) ? "home-beta" : "home";
    }
}
```

The first thing to notice is that I am injecting the `SplitClient` using constructor dependency injection.

The real magic happens with the `splitClient.getTreatment` call. The first parameter is the username provided by Spring Security for the authenticated user.

> Note that in much of the Split documentation, this first parameter is referred to as a `key`. Don't confuse this with the API Key, which should NEVER be used as the first parameter to the `getTreatment` call.

The second parameter is the name of the treatment in Split that we want to target.

The third parameter sends a map where the key is **groups** and the value is the list of group names that the authenticated user belongs to. In the case of our user **linda**, this will be **Everyone** (among some other defaults). In the case of our user **louise**, this will be **Everyone** and **BETA_TESTER**.

The last line of the controller method now returns the **home-beta** template if the result of **getTreatment** is **on** and the **home** template otherwise.

Fire up the app and try to login as **linda** in an incognito window. You should see the same home template as before. Kill that incognito window, open another one and login as **louise**. You should see the new beta template.

{% img blog/okta-split-spring-security/beta-experience.png alt:"beta experience" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

### Make Your New Functionality Generally Available

Now that we have different treatments of our home template for regular users and beta testers, you may be wondering how to go about making the beta template available to everyone?

Split makes it easy-peasy. Go back to your Split definition for **BETA_UI_EXPERIENCE** and switch the **serve** setting in the **Set The Default Rule** section from **off** to **on**. Save and Confirm the change.

Without restarting the Spring Boot application, login as **linda** again. You should now see the same page that you saw for **louise** earlier.

Pretty cool, eh?

### How to Repeat the Beta / Release Cycle

With this architecture in place, it's now very easy to set up a new beta cycle. The steps would be something like this:

1. Copy the `home-beta.html` template to `home.html` (now that it's ready for production)
2. Create a new `home-beta.html` template
3. Set the default rule back to **off** in Split
4. Redeploy the app
5. Let your beta testers test the new experience
6. When ready, set the default rule back to **on** in Split
7. NO NEED TO REDEPLOY

You could do this over and over again and never touch the controller code. The only thing that's changing are the templates and the settings in split.

This approach also lends itself to changing who is in your beta test program without having to change your code.

In a real application, you'd be working with a database or an Identity Management system where you could add and remove users from the **BETA_TESTER** group. With Okta, you can easily manage who belongs to the group from the admin console or via the Okta Management API. Those users would always see the latest and greatest beta while ordinary users would see only the current release.
