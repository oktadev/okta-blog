## Why come to Oktane 

Developers make it possible for anyone to use Okta's identity cloud to connect securely to any online technology, anywhere. Whether you support Okta in the workplace, or build on our *Auth0 by Okta* offering for authorizaton and authentication, whether you're a newcomer or a veteran of the IAM (Identity and Access Management) space, we'd love to meet you at Oktane. Engineers and developer advocates will share roadmaps and knowledge through talks, workshops, and 1:1 conversations. Come for the learning and stay for the good times. As always, we want to hear from you about your pain points, feature requests, and ideas for the future. 

## Developer workshops and presentations

Our speakers are developers from Okta and Auth0 by Okta, as well as engineers from around the world who work with our platform. They'll cover best practices for protecting your front-end and back-end with OAuth. You'll learn how Okta APIs and SDKs can help take care of authentication, authorization, and user management for your application. We're bringing our latest hands-on workshops and challenges (road-tested and refined at Developer Days), as well as 1:1 consultations with solutions architects to the Oktane Developer Hub. 

## Agenda overview 

We've curated [a great lineup for developers](https://www.okta.com/oktane22/agenda/?filters=developer) to make sure you get the most out of your Oktane experience this year. Note: All times are PDT, and talks are 30 minutes; the Developer keynote at 3:30pm on Wednesday runs 45 minutes and includes demos of our bright passwordless future. This keynote will be featured on the live stream. Recordings will be posted to the [OktaDev YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/oktadev) in the weeks ahead. Stay tuned.  

*Wednesday, November 9:*

**11:00 am - Using React to Customize Your Auth0 User Experience**<br/>
Brandon Weber, CTO, [Basis Theory](https://basistheory.com/)

>React with Auth0 by Okta offers a powerful way to bring CI/CD, automation, and customization to your identity workflows. With a simple app in React, we used a modern tool chain to build our identity UI, and leverage the Auth0 Deploy CLI Tool to automatically push those changes live. In this session, we'll show how we use React to style our sign-up and sign-in user flows in concert with Auth0 by Okta.


**1:45 pm - HTTP Security Headers Refresher**<br/>
Amin Abbaspour, Lead Solutions Architect, Okta

>Here's a developer-friendly refresher on how to harden website and browser security leveraging extended HTTP headers. We'll cover CORS, HSTS, CSP and more.


**3:30pm - Customer Identity Cloud for Devs: Building a Passwordless World** (*Keynote*)<br/>
Shiven Ramji, Chief Product Officer, CIC, Okta<br/>
Bhawna Singh, SVP, Engineering, Okta<br/>
Vittorio Bertocci, Principal Architect, Okta<br/>

>It's time to move beyond centrally-stored passwords and to free everyone to safely use any technology. In this hour, we'll explore the latest capabilities of the Customer Identity Cloud and how we can build a better identity experience together. And we will discuss how Okta and our partners are making it easier for every developer to secure their customers' identities. 


**4:30 pm - Integrating Okta's New Push SDK**<br/>
Hans Reichenbach, Software Architect, Okta

>This session will focus on how to integrate the new Push SDK into your mobile application. Starting with a simple integration, we'll look at how to integrate your existing authentication flows to get access tokens for the SDK to use in enrolling and maintaining itself. Our wrap-up will feature the upcoming Transactional MFA functionality being built to support securing high risk actions in your product.

*Thursday, November 10*

**10:15am Terraform-Driven Auth0 Customization Using Modern CI/CD**<br/>
Brandon Michelsen, Senior Software Engineer, Google<br/>
Daphnne Chacon, Associate Solutions Architect, Okta<br/>

>This project-driven presentation will demonstrate how you can customize Auth0 by Okta using Terraform and GitHub Actions, with considerations made for production-grade deployment paradigms. The speakers show you how they managed deployment of a SPA with an accompanying back-end, from developer testing through to promoting their project into production.

**12:00pm Building an Identity Platform Using Okta for Healthcare Applications**<br/>
Ashwini Mutalik Desai, Software Development Manager, [Medly](https://medly.com/en-us)

>Medly is a digital pharmacy with B2B and B2C applications for daily use. As part of the platform, we built tooling and abstractions for product teams to standardize the IAM workflow. This talk walks through our experiences in building this engineer-friendly, secure, and compliant platform using Okta. We'll look at creating abstractions on top of Okta's API, SDKs for backend services, and using React hooks in frontend apps for a good developer experience.
