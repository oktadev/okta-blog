Microservices have been quite popular in the Java ecosystem ever since Spring Boot and Spring Cloud made them easy to build and deploy. Things have gotten even easier in recent years with the proliferation of new Java frameworks built specifically for microservices: MicroProfile, Micronaut, Quarkus, and Helidon. Not only do these framework provide a nice developer experience, they also tend to have built-in Docker support. They even work with GraalVM so you can compile your apps to native code!

_To be fair, MicroProfile isn't a framework, it's a spec with many implementations. In fact, both Quarkus and Helidon have MicroProfile flavors you can use._

Today, I'll show you how to build a Java microservices architecture that leverages micro frontends for the UI. The backend will use Spring Boot and Spring Cloud while the frontend will use React. You can also use Angular or Vue if you'd like.

**Prerequisites:**

- https://sdkman.io/[Java] 11+
- https://nodejs.com/[Node.js] 16+
- https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop]
- https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/[JHipster] 7.9.3

You can install JHipster with npm:

[source,shell]

npm i -g generator-jhipster@7.9.3

== Java microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster

JHipster is an application generator that creates a Spring Boot backend. You can configure it to use SQL or NoSQL databases, plain ol' Spring MVC, or reactive with WebFlux. It also generates a UI for your REST API and offers you the choice of Angular, React, or Vue. Last year, I showed you how to build link:/blog/2021/01/20/reactive-java-microservices[reactive Java microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster]. In this tutorial, you build a gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway. Then, you create a blog microservice and a store microservice, each with their own database.

[.red]#todo: architecture diagram#

This microservices architecture had one major flaw: the UI for it is a monolith, with all its files on the gateway. This isn't good from a loose-coupling point of view because changes in a microservice might require changes in the UI. Instead of being able to independently deploy the microservice, you have to deploy the gateway too.

Today, I'm proud to show you how to you can solve this problem with micro frontends. JHipster recently added support for micro-frontends. Microfrontends provide a way for you to remotely load and execute code at runtime so your microservice's UI can live in the same artifact, without being coupled to the gateway!

[.red]#todo: microfrontends diagram#

You might notice I spelled micro frontends three different ways in the previous paragraph. The current literature is all over the place on this one!

I'm going to use "micro frontends" for the remainder of this post since that's what https://twitter.com/thecamjackson[Cam Jackson] used in his https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html[Micro Frontends article] on Martin Fowler's blog.

== A quick introduction to Module Federation

// todo: include a diagram like https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends/deployment.png

Webpack's https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/[Module Federation] is one of the best known implementations for micro frontends. Its https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-federation-plugin[`ModuleFederationPlugin`] allows a build to provide or consume modules with other independent builds at runtime. It even allows you to share libraries between frontends to reduce the size of remote bundles.

https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy[Zack Jackson] is the creator of Module Federation and recently https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy/status/1564411584851505153[collaborated] with https://twitter.com/ManfredSteyer[Manfred Steyer] to create Native Federation. This means you can use micro frontend concepts with any build tool, not just webpack.

== Why should Java developers care?

I think micro frontends an excellent architecture concept. With microservices, you weave everything together on the backend with protocols like HTTP, gRPC, and GraphQL. With micro frontends, it's all HTTP. You can literally see your app get stitched together by watching your browser's network console and seeing remote modules load.

I've encountered quite a few monolith UIs in my time as a consultant. The backend was a beautiful microservice architecture, but it was all coupled together on the frontend. There's a good chance a lot of Java developers don't care about the UI because they just work on the beautiful backends. However, if you consider yourself a Java _web_ developer, micro frontends are as revolutionary as HTML5!

And that's the beauty of this tutorial, you don't have to write any micro frontends. JHipster can create them for you!

== Micro frontends in action with JHipster

I used a JDL (JHipster Domain Language) file named `reactive-ms.jdl` to create the reactive Java microservices tutorial I mentioned earlier. You can see this file online in the https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples/blob/main/reactive-ms.jdl[JDL samples repository].

I copied this file to `reactive-mf.jdl` and changed a few things for this tutorial:

. Enabled micro frontends by adding `microfrontends [blog, store]` to the gateway's definition.
. Changed the client framework from Vue to React.
. Added `clientFramework react` and Cypress to each microservice.
. Changed the service discovery to https://www.consul.io/[Consul].^1^
. Added a deployment section for Kubernetes.

^1^ We'll default to Consul in JHipster v8.

Run the following command to create a new directory for your micro frontends project:

[source,shell]
----
take micro-frontends-jhipster
# mkdir micro-frontends-jhipster && cd micro-frontends-jhipster if you don't have take installed
----

Download both the `-ms` and `-mf` JDLs and compare them in IntelliJ IDEA. You'll need IDEA's https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-the-ide-features-from-command-line.html[Command-line Launcher] for the `idea` command to work.

[source,shell]
----
jhipster download reactive-ms.jdl
jhipster download reactive-mf.jdl
idea diff reactive-ms.jdl reactive-mf.jdl
----

image::{% asset_path 'blog/micro-frontends-java/jdl-with-kubernetes.png' %}[alt=Additional K8s deployment,width=800,align=center,link={% asset_path 'blog/micro-frontends-java/jdl-with-kubernetes.png' %}]

TIP: The https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19697-jhipster-jdl[JHipster JDL Plugin] is a handy tool for working with JDL files.

=== Micro frontend options: Angular, React, and Vue

JHipster has support for the big three JavaScript frameworks: Angular, React, and Vue. All are implemented using TypeScript and a newly generated app should have around 70% code coverage, both on the backend and frontend.

There is also a https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-svelte[Svelte blueprint], but it does not support micro frontends at the time of this writing.

=== Build Java microservices with Spring Boot and WebFlux

To generate a microservices architecture with micro frontend support, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
jhipster jdl reactive-mf.jdl --monorepository --workspaces
----

The last two arguments are optional, but I expect you to use them for this tutorial. Without the `monorepository` flag, the gateway and microservices would have their own Git repos. The `workspaces` flag enables https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces[npm workspaces], which are kinda like having a parent `pom.xml` that allows you to execute commands across projects. It also makes it so there's only one `node_modules` in the root directory. To learn more, I recommend egghead's https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-monorepos-with-npm-workspaces-c03f500b[Introduction to Monorepos with NPM Workspaces].

If you want to use Angular, you can pass in `--client-framework angularX` to override the JDL value. For example:

[source,shell]
----
# Micro Frontends with Angular
jhipster jdl reactive-mf.jdl --client-framework angularX --monorepository --workspaces
----

IMPORTANT: `angularX` is a legacy JDL value from back when JHipster supported AngularJS and Angular 2. It will be changed to `angular` in v8.

If you'd rather try out Vue, use the following:

[source,shell]
----
# Micro Frontends with Vue
jhipster jdl reactive-mf.jdl --client-framework vue --monorepository --workspaces
----

=== Run your reactive Spring Boot microservices

When the process is complete, cd into the `gateway` directory and start Keycloak and Consul using Docker Compose.

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
docker compose -f src/main/docker/consul.yml up -d
----

Then, run `./gradlew` (or `npm run app:start` if you prefer npm commands). When the startup process completes, open your favorite browser to `\http://localhost:8080`, and log in with the credentials displayed on the page.

You'll be redirected back to the gateway, but the **Entities** menu won't have any links because the micro frontends it tries to load are unavailable.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/micro-frontends-java/gateway-entities-unavailable.png' %}[alt=The gateway's entities are unavailable,width=800,align=center]

Start the `blog` by opening a terminal and navigating to its directory. Then, start its database with Docker and the app with Gradle.

[source,shell]
----
npm run docker:db:up
./gradlew
----

Open a new terminal and do the same for the `store` microservice.

You can verify everything is started using Consul at `\http://localhost:8500`.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/micro-frontends-java/consul-services.png' %}[alt=Consul services,width=800,align=center]

Refresh the gateway app, and you should see menu items to navigate to the microservices now.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/micro-frontends-java/gateway-entities-available.png' %}[alt=Gateway entities available,width=800,align=center]

// === Rapid dev with micro frontends and JHipster
// === Rapid development that sparks joy
=== Zero turnaround development that sparks joy

At this point, I've only shown you how to run the Spring Boot backends with their packaged React apps. What if you want to work on the UI and have zero turnaround that sparks joy? ✨🤗

// emojis about joy

In the gateway app, run `npm start`. This will run the UI on its own web server, open a browser window to `\http://localhost:9000`, and use https://browsersync.io/[Browsersync] to keep your browser in sync with your code.

Modify the code in `gateway/src/main/webapp/app/modules/home/home.tsx` to make a quick change. For example, add the following below the `<h2>`.

[source,jsx]
----
<h3 className="text-primary">
  Hi, I'm a quick edit!
</h3>
----

You'll see this change immediately appear within your browser.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/micro-frontends-java/gateway-quick-edit.png' %}[alt=Gateway quick edit,width=800,align=center]

Remove it and it'll disappear right away too.

Now, open another terminal and navigate into the `store` directory. Run `npm start` and you'll have a similar zero-turnaround experience when modifying files in the `store` app. The app will start a webserver on `\http://localhost:9002` and there will only be one menu item for product. Modify files in the `store/src/main/webapp/app/entities/store/product` directory, and you'll see the changes in your browser immediately. For example, change the wrapper `<div>` in `product.tsx` to have a background color:

[source,html]
----
<div className="bg-info">
----

The UI will change before you can kbd:[Cmd+Tab] back to your browser.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/micro-frontends-java/store-edit.png' %}[alt=Store edit,width=800,align=center]

The backend has quick turnaround abilities too thanks to https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using.html#using.devtools[Spring Boot devtools]. If you modify a backend class, recompiling it will cause Spring Boot to reload your component lickety-split. It's pretty slick!

=== A look under the hood of micro frontends

When you're learning concepts like micro frontends, it's often helpful to look at the code that makes things work.

The gateway's `webpack.microfrontend.js` handles setting up the `@blog` and `@store` remotes, as well as specifying the shared dependencies and components between apps.

== Build and run with Docker

To build Docker images for each application, run the following command from the root directory.

[source,shell]
----
npm run java:docker
----

If you're using a Mac with Apple Silicon, the command is slightly different.

[source,shell]
----
npm run java:docker:arm64
----

TIP: You can see all npm scripts with `npm run`.

Then, navigate to the `docker-compose` directory and start all the containers.

[source,shell]
----
cd docker-compose
docker compose up
----

This will start and run all the apps, their databases, Consul, and Keycloak. To make Keycloak work, you need to add the following line to your hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Mac/Linux, `c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows).

----
127.0.0.1	keycloak
----

This is because you will access your application with a browser on your machine (where the name is localhost, or `127.0.0.1`), but inside Docker it will run in its own container, where the name is `keycloak`.

If you want to prove everything works, make sure everything is started at `\http://localhost:8500`, then run `npm run e2e -ws` from the root project directory. This will run the Cypress tests that JHipster generates in your browser.

== Switch identity providers

JHipster ships with Keycloak when you choose OAuth 2.0 / OIDC as the authentication type. However, you can easily change it to another identity provider, like Auth0!

First, you'll need to register a regular web application. Log in to your Auth0 account (or https://auth0.com/signup[sign up] if you don't have an account). You should have a unique domain like `dev-xxx.us.auth0.com`.

Select *Create Application* in the https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications[Applications section]. Use a name like `Micro Frontends`, select `Regular Web Applications`, and click *Create*.

Switch to the *Settings* tab and configure your application settings:

- Allowed Callback URLs: `\http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc`
- Allowed Logout URLs: `\http://localhost:8080/`

Scroll to the bottom and click *Save Changes*.

In the https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles[roles] section, create new roles named `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER`.

Create a new user account in the https://manage.auth0.com/#/users[users] section. Click the *Role* tab to assign the roles you just created to the new account.

_Make sure your new user's email is verified before attempting to log in!_

Next, head to **Actions** > **Flows** and select **Login**. Create a new action named `Add Roles` and use the default trigger and runtime. Change the `onExecutePostLogin` handler to be as follows:

[source,js]
----
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const namespace = 'https://www.jhipster.tech';
  if (event.authorization) {
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim('preferred_username', event.user.email);
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
    api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
  }
}
----

This code adds the user's roles to a custom claim (prefixed with `\https://www.jhipster.tech/roles`). This claim is mapped to Spring Security authorities in `SecurityUtils.java` in the gateway app.

Select **Deploy** and drag the `Add Roles` action to your Login flow.

Edit `docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml` and append the following block of YAML to add your Auth0 settings.

[source,yaml]
----
jhipster:
  security:
    ...
    oauth2:
      audience: https://dev-06bzs1cu.us.auth0.com/api/v2/

spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://<your-auth0-domain>/ # make sure to include the trailing slash!
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: <your-client-id>
            client-secret: <your-client-secret>
----

NOTE: Want to have all these steps automated for you? Vote for https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli/issues/351[issue #351] in the Auth0 CLI project.

Stop all your Docker containers with kbd:[Ctrl+C] and start them again.

[source,shell]
----
docker compose up
----

Now, Spring Security will be configured to use Auth0 and Consul will distribute these settings to all your microservices. When everything is started, navigate to `\http://localhost:8080` and click **sign in**. You will be prompted for your Auth0 credentials.

After entering your credentials, you'll be redirected back to the gateway and your username will be displayed.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/micro-frontends-java/auth0-login-success.png' %}[alt=Auth0 login success,width=800,align=center]

You should be able to add, edit, and delete blogs, posts, tags, and products, proving that all of your microservices and micro frontends can talk to each other.

// === Use Okta for identity

If you'd like to use Okta for your identity provider, see https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta[JHipster's documentation].

[TIP]
====
You can configure JHipster quickly with the https://cli.okta.com[Okta CLI]:

[source,shell]
----
okta apps create jhipster
----
====

== Deploy with Kubernetes

The JDL you used to generate this microservices stack has a section at the bottom for deploying to Kubernetes.

----
deployment {
  deploymentType kubernetes
  appsFolders [gateway, blog, store]
  clusteredDbApps [store]
  kubernetesNamespace demo
  kubernetesUseDynamicStorage true
  kubernetesStorageClassName ""
  serviceDiscoveryType consul
  dockerRepositoryName "mraible"
}
----

The `jhipster jdl` command generates a `kubernetes` directory with this information and configures all your apps, databases, and Consul to be Kubernetes-ready. If you have a Kubernetes cluster created, you can deploy to its `demo` namespace using the following command.

[source,shell]
----
./kubectl-apply.sh -f
----

It also generates files for Kustomize and Skaffold, if you'd prefer to use those tools. See the https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-micro-frontends-jhipster-example/blob/main/kubernetes/K8S-README.md[`kubernetes/K8S-README.md`] file for more information.

I won't go into the nitty-gritty details of deploying a JHipster microservices stack to cloud providers with K8s, mostly because it's covered in previous blog posts. The first post below shows how to run Minikube locally, encrypt your secrets, and deploy to Google Cloud.

== Learn more about micro frontends and microservices

I hope you enjoyed this overview of how to use micro frontends within a Java microservices architecture. I like how micro frontends allow each microservice application to be self-contained and deployable, independent of the other microservices. It's also pretty neat how JHipster generates Docker and Kubernetes configuration for you. Cloud native FTW!

You can find the source code for this example on GitHub, in the https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-micro-frontends-jhipster-example[@oktadev/auth0-micro-frontends-jhipster-example] repository.
