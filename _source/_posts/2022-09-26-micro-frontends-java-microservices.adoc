== A quick introduction to micro frontends

// Explain what they are in simple terms - remote loading JS code at runtime
// Module Federation - https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/

== Why should Java developers care?

== Micro frontends in action with JHipster

// https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/01/20/reactive-java-microservices

=== Micro frontend options: Angular, React, and Vue

=== Build Java microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud

// --client-framework angularX,react,vue

=== Run your Spring Boot microservices

// === Rapid dev with micro frontends and JHipster
// === Rapid development that sparks joy
=== Zero turnaround development that sparks joy

Micro Frontends Demo

1. jhipster jdl reactive-mf --skip-install # mention —workspaces —monorepository --client-framework options
2. Start gateway, show how entities menu has "error loading component" for microservices
3. Open all projects in IDE, show code and module federation specifics
4. Start blog, show how gateway > entities menu has blog entities
5. Start store, show how gateway > entities > Product now renders
6. Show how you can use `npm start` in the gateway app, make changes, and see them right away
7. Run `npm start` in the blog app, show how changes can be viewed immediately
8. Shut down gateway and show what happens to blog app
9. Build Docker containers for all apps (note about need to run `npm run java:docker:arm64`)
10. Run in Docker Compose or with K8s and minikube

Optional:

- Run Cypress e2e tests on one of the apps
- Mention workspaces and show how you can run e2e tests for all apps, or just show how to convert to a mono repo https://egghead.io/lessons/npm-intro-to-monorepos-with-npm-workspaces-outro

== Build and run with Docker

== Deploy with Kubernetes

////
These might be better in single succinct paragraph rather than in
headers that make things longer and space things out more.

=== Use Minikube locally
=== Google Cloud, AWS, and Digital Ocean
=== CI/CD with Circle CI and Spinnaker
////
