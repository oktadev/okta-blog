What makes a SaaS application ready for enterprise customers? Between handling application security, user onboarding, and scalable and secure authentication practices, there's much to consider and prepare before determining your app is "enterprise ready."

## Road to making your SaaS applications enterprise-ready

We recently hosted a half-day virtual conference covering this topic at [WIC Devday 23](https://developerday.com/events/devday23-wic). We launched the event with a keynote covering why enterprise readiness is essential and what considerations to take. We invited Arnab Bose, Chief Product Officer, Workforce Identity Cloud at Okta, to lead the important "Why" and "What" questions.
