Document databases have become increasingly popular due to their speed and ability to store huge amounts of data or semi-structured data. MongoDB has emerged as a leader in the document database space and, as a consequence, it may be necessary for developers to learn how to interact with MongoDB from .NET applications. This post strips away all the arguments that obscure how document databases can easily serve as a datastore for .NET applications.

The app you'll build is a virtual suggestion box. It is meant to strip away anything that doesn't deal with saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting data from the document store.

For this example, you'll use MongoDB's [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). Atlas is a hosted solution for MongoDB clusters. You can easily sign up for a free account. You'll also use Okta for user authentication (you can also [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/signup) for a free account).

## Scaffold Your ASP.NET Core Application

For this application, I'll show you all the command-line commands for creating the application, coding in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). You could use Visual Studio but, if you're on macOS or Linux, you won't have that ability. 

To scaffold a basic ASP.NET Core MVC application, use the following command:

```sh
dotnet new mvc --no-https -n OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample
```

This command creates the application in a folder called `OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample`. It also tells the .NET Core SDK not to use `https` for the development URL. Obviously, if this were a production application, you would want to leave that on. 

Next, change into the `OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample` folder and open VSCode in that directory. From there, install the two packages you need for the application to work:

```sh
dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver -v 2.10.4
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect -v 3.1.4 
```

The `MongoDB.Driver` package allows .NET Core to connect to the MongoDB database. ou'll use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect` to authenticate to Okta.

## Set Up Your Free MongoDB Cluster

Once you've signed up for a free MongoDB cluster (I just used my Google account), you should be taken to a page that lists your clusters. The only cluster that should be in there to begin with is called **Cluster0**. Click on the **COLLECTIONS** button, then click the **+ Create Database** button and create a database called "SuggestMe" with a collection of "Submissions". You can have as many collections in the database as you want, but for the purposes of the "SuggestMe" app, all you'll need is the "Submissions" collection.

{% img blog/aspnet-core-mongodb/mongo-create-db.png alt:"Create Mongo Database" width:"400" %}{: .center-image }

## Connect Your .NET Core Application to the MongoDB Database

Add your database connection information to the `appsettings.json` file in the root of your application. After the `Logging` section of the JSON document, add:

```json
"DatabaseSettings": {
    "ConnectionString": "{MongoDBConnectionString}",
    "DatabaseName": "SuggestMe"
},
```

If you go back to the clusters listing by clicking the **Clusters** menu item on the left, you can then click the **CONNECT** button. 

{% img blog/aspnet-core-mongodb/mongo-connect.png alt:"Connect to Mongo Database" width:"650" %}{: .center-image }

Replace the `{MongoDBConnectionString}` placeholder with your connection string from MongoDB Atlas. You can copy it directly from the **CONNECT** dialog and replace your admin password (or, even better, add a new user to the database specifically for your application to use) and put that user and password in the connection string. Also, replace the `<dbname>` in the connection string with `suggestme` for your database.

Next, you'll need some classes to get the connection working correctly. In your `Models` folder, add a file called `DatabaseSettings.cs`. The contents of the file will be:

```cs
namespace OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample.Models
{
    public interface IDatabaseSettings
    {
        string ConnectionString { get; set; }
        string DatabaseName { get; set; }
    }

    public class DatabaseSettings : IDatabaseSettings
    {
        public string ConnectionString { get; set; }
        public string DatabaseName { get; set; }
    }
}
```

You might notice there are a class and an interface in this file. Again, this is just for simplicity's sake. You can easily separate them into two files if you would like.

The interface will allow you to inject the database connection into any class that needs it using the dependency injection framework built into .NET Core. Do so by going into the `Startup.cs` file in the root of your project and adding to the beginning of the `ConfigureServices` method:

```cs
services.Configure<DatabaseSettings>(Configuration.GetSection(nameof(DatabaseSettings)));
services.AddSingleton<IDatabaseSettings>(x => x.GetRequiredService<IOptions<DatabaseSettings>>().Value);
```

This will pull the settings from `appsettings.json` file into the properties of the `DatabaseSettings` object and inject them anywhere another object requires a `IDatabaseSettings` contract to be fulfilled.

In the `Models` folder, create a file called `Submission.cs` with the following contents:

```cs
using System;
using MongoDB.Bson;
using MongoDB.Bson.Serialization.Attributes;

namespace OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample.Models
{
    public class Submission
    {
        [BsonId]
        [BsonRepresentation(BsonType.ObjectId)]
        public string Id { get; set; }

        public string UserId { get; set; }
        
        public string UserName { get; set; }

        public string Content { get; set; }

        public DateTime Created { get; set; }

        public DateTime LastUpdated { get; set; }
    }
}
```

## Prepare the .NET Core Application to Store Data in MongoDB

Notice the `MongoDB.Bson` and `MongoDB.Bson.Serialization.Attributes` namespaces that are added. These allow the MongoDB package to handle serialization and the document identifier as a `BSON` type. The rest of the code is a regular C Sharp class.

Now, add a folder called `Services` and to it, add a class file called `SubmissionService.cs`. This will be the class that communicates with the MongoDB data store.

```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;
using MongoDB.Driver;
using OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample.Models;

namespace OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample.Services
{

    public class SubmissionService
    {
        private readonly IMongoCollection<Submission> _submissions;

        public SubmissionService(IDatabaseSettings settings)
        {
            var client = new MongoClient(settings.ConnectionString);
            var database = client.GetDatabase(settings.DatabaseName);
            _submissions = database.GetCollection<Submission>("Submissions");
        }

        public Submission Create(Submission submission)
        {
            _submissions.InsertOne(submission);
            return submission;
        }

        public IList<Submission> Read() =>
            _submissions.Find(sub => true).ToList();

        public Submission Find(string id) =>
            _submissions.Find(sub=>sub.Id == id).SingleOrDefault();

        public void Update(Submission submission) =>
            _submissions.ReplaceOne(sub => sub.Id == submission.Id, submission);

        public void Delete(string id) =>
            _submissions.DeleteOne(sub => sub.Id == id);
    }
}
```

It seems like a lot to unpack, but most of it is likely stuff you have seen before. The `IDatabaseSettings` is injected with your `DatabaseSettings` object carrying the connection information for the `MongoClient` object instantiated in the constructor. Then, the database is retrieved and the "Submissions" collection.

All of the data interaction methods here use the MongoDB driver syntax. Things like `InsertOne`, `Find`, `ReplaceOne`, and `DeleteOne` all do exactly as their name suggests. Then, lambda functions are passed to them to determine which documents in the `Submissions` collection to `Find` or `Replace`, etc. Everything else works exactly like a SQL-centric method would by returning lists, single documents, or nothing.

Add a single line to your `Startup.cs` file right below the dependency injection code you added earlier. This will inject the `SubmissionService` into any class that requires it:

```cs
services.AddSingleton<SubmissionService>();
```

Then, add a `SubmissionController.cs` to your `Controllers` folder to glue all of this together:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Claims;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample.Models;
using OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample.Services;

namespace OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class SubmissionController : Controller 
    {
        private readonly SubmissionService _subSvc;

        public SubmissionController(SubmissionService submissionService)
        {
            _subSvc = submissionService;
        }

        [AllowAnonymous]
        public ActionResult<IList<Submission>> Index() => View(_subSvc.Read());

        [HttpGet]
        public ActionResult Create() => View();
        
        [HttpPost]
        [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
        public ActionResult<Submission> Create(Submission submission){
            submission.Created = submission.LastUpdated = DateTime.Now;
            submission.UserId = User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(c=>c.Type == ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier).Value;
            submission.UserName = User.Identity.Name;
            if(ModelState.IsValid){
                _subSvc.Create(submission);
            }
            return RedirectToAction("Index");
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public ActionResult<Submission> Edit(string id) => 
            View(_subSvc.Find(id));

        [HttpPost]
        [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
        public ActionResult Edit(Submission submission)
        {
            submission.LastUpdated = DateTime.Now;
            submission.Created = submission.Created.ToLocalTime();
            if(ModelState.IsValid){
                if(User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(c=>c.Type == ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier).Value != submission.UserId)
                {
                    return Unauthorized();
                }
                _subSvc.Update(submission);
                return RedirectToAction("Index");
            }
            return View(submission);
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public ActionResult Delete(string id)
        {
            _subSvc.Delete(id);
            return RedirectToAction("Index");
        }
    }
}
```

The `SubmissionService` will be injected into the controller to make it easy to call those methods. You've also added actions to handle everything a user would want to do for a submission. The `Create()` and `Edit()` actions add `Created` and `LastUpdated` properties to the submission object to be saved or updated.

> You may notice something kind of weird here: the `Edit()` action actually takes the `Created` property and converts it `ToLocalTime()`. This is because the MongoDB driver converts the dates to a GMT date. The interface for updating submissions has a hidden field for the date in a local date format, but it doesn't **convert** the value. So you'll need to convert the value to the local date-time. That way, when MongoDB converts it to GMT it's not off.

The `Create()` action adds a `Created` and `LastUpdated` value of `DateTime.Now` as well as the `UserId` and `UserName` of the currently logged in user. You'll notice there is an `[Authorize]` attribute on the whole controller with an `[AllowAnonymous]` attribute only on the `Index()` action. This will ensure that anyone can view the list of suggestions, but any other action taken on the suggestions requires the user be logged in.

## Add Views to the .NET Core Application

You'll need some user interface elements for the user to add and edit suggestions. Add a folder called `Submission` to the `Views` folder of the application. Then, on the suggestion listing page,  add an `Index.cshtml` view with the following contents:

```html
@model IEnumerable<OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample.Models.Submission>

<h1>List of Ideas</h1>

    @foreach (var sub in Model)
    {
        <div class="idea">
            <span>Created By: @sub.UserName on @sub.Created.ToLocalTime()</span>
            <span>Last Updated: @sub.LastUpdated.ToLocalTime()</span>
            <div>
                @sub.Content
            </div>
            @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated && User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(c=>c.Type == System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier).Value == @sub.UserId)
            {
                <a asp-action="Edit" asp-route-id="@sub.Id">edit</a>
                <a asp-action="Delete" asp-route-id="@sub.Id">delete</a>
            }
        </div>   
    }
<hr/>
<a class="create" asp-action="Create">Add New Idea</a>
```

This view declares the `Submission` model list at the top, then loops through the list and displays each submission in a `div` block. For the actions available for each submission, it checks to see if there is a logged-in user and if the logged-in user is the one who created the submission. This ensures that only the person who created that particular submission can edit or delete it.

You'll also need a view for creating and editing submissions. Add a `Create.cshtml` and `Edit.cshtml` file to the `Submission` folder.

**Create.cshtml**
```html
@model OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample.Models.Submission

<form asp-action="Create">
    <fieldset class="idea-form">
        <h2>Submit an Idea</h2>
        @Html.TextAreaFor(m=>m.Content)
        <input type="submit" name="Create" />
    </fieldset>
</form>
```

**Edit.cshtml**
```html
@model OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample.Models.Submission

<form asp-action="Edit">
    <fieldset class="idea-form">
        @Html.HiddenFor(m => m.Created)
        @Html.HiddenFor(m=>m.UserId)
        @Html.HiddenFor(m=>m.UserName)
        @Html.LabelFor(m => m.Content)
        @Html.TextAreaFor(m => m.Content)
        <input type="submit" name="Update" />
    </fieldset>
</form>
```

The only things really remarkable here are the hidden fields for the `Created`, `UserId`, and `UserName` properties in the edit form. These will ensure the values are passed back without exposing them to edits.

I added a little CSS magic to make the views look a little more presentable. In the `wwwroot/css/site.css` file at the bottom, I added:

```css
/* Idea specific styles */

.idea {
  border: solid 1px #DDD;
  padding: .5rem;
  margin-bottom: .5rem;
}

.idea > span {
  font-size: .75rem;
  color: #AAA;
  font-style: italic;
  padding: .5rem;
}

.idea > div {
  padding: .5rem;
}

a.create {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  text-align: right;
}

.idea-form > * {
  display: block;
}

.idea-form > textarea {
  height: 5rem;
  width: 100%;
}
```

## Add Authentication to the .NET Core Application

Lastly, you'll need to add authentication using Okta so that the application can enforce the rule that only users who created a submission can edit or delete those submissions. Start by creating an application in Okta—go to your Okta dashboard, click on **Applications** in the top menu and then click the green **Add Application** button. Choose **Web** and click **Next**.

In the **Application Settings**, name the application "SuggestMe" then change the **Base URIs** to `http://localhost:5000/`, the **Login redirect URIs** to `http://localhost:5000/signin-oidc` and the **Logout redirect URIs** to `http://localhost:5000/signout-callback-oidc`. All the other default values should be fine.

{% img blog/aspnet-core-mongodb/okta-app-settings.png alt:"Okta App Settings" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

When you click **Done**, you should be directed to the application settings page. On the **General** tab at the bottom, you'll see a box with a **ClientId** and **ClientSecret**. Copy those to a new section in `appsettings.json` below the database settings you added earlier:

```json
"Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}",
    "Domain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
    "PostLogoutRedirectUri": "http://localhost:5000"
},
```

You can find your Okta domain URL on the top right of your Okta dashboard.

{% img blog/aspnet-core-mongodb/okta-org-url.png alt:"Okta Org URL" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, add a file called `AccountController.cs` to the `Controllers` folder like so:

```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace DockerPipelineExample.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Login()
        {
            if(!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
              return Challenge(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
            }
            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }

        public IActionResult Logout()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(new[]
            {
              OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
              CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme
            });
        }
    }
}
```

This adds actions for logging in and logging out that can then be used by the application to facilitate authentication with Okta. 

Finally, you'll add navigation so that users can get to all this cool stuff! In the `Views/Shared` folder add a file called `_LoginPartial.cshtml`. This will be the partial view that contains navigation and display elements for authentication routes:

```html
@if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
{
    <ul class="navbar-nav">
        <li>
            <span class="navbar-text">Hello, @User.Identity.Name</span> &nbsp;
            <a onclick="document.getElementById('logout_form').submit();" style="cursor: pointer;">Log out</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <form asp-controller="Account" asp-action="Logout" method="post" id="logout_form"></form>
}
else
{
    <ul class="navbar-nav">
        <li><a asp-controller="Account" asp-action="Login">Log in</a></li>
    </ul>
}
```

This will display the user's name and a logout button when the user is logged in, as well as a login button when they're not. All that's left is to add it to the main navigation. Change the `_Layout.cshtml` file so that it looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>@ViewData["Title"] - OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" />
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm navbar-toggleable-sm navbar-light bg-white border-bottom box-shadow mb-3">
            <div class="container">
                <a class="navbar-brand" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample</a>
                <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent"
                        aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
                    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
                </button>
                <div class="navbar-collapse collapse justify-content-between">
                <ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
                    <li class="nav-item">
                        <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">Home</a>
                    </li>
                    <li class="nav-item">
                        <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="Submission" asp-action="Index">Ideas</a>
                    </li>
                    <li class="nav-item">
                        <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Privacy">Privacy</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <partial name="_LoginPartial" />
                </div>
            </div>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <main role="main" class="pb-3">
            @RenderBody()
        </main>
    </div>

    <footer class="border-top footer text-muted">
        <div class="container">
            &copy; 2020 - OktaNetCoreMvcMongoExample - <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Privacy">Privacy</a>
        </div>
    </footer>
    <script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
    <script src="~/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true"></script>
    @RenderSection("Scripts", required: false)
</body>
</html>
```

You'll see the new login partial after the `ul` for the menu. I've also changed the classes on the `navbar-collapse` element adding the `justify-content-between` class. That will move the login partial to the right side of the menu while leaving the regular navigation on the left. I also added the `mr-auto` class that will justify it to the right.

## Run Your New .NET Core and MongoDB Application

You should now be able to fire this new application up with either an `F5` from VS Code or by typing `dotnet run` in a terminal in the folder where the application is.
