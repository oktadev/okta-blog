What does it take to build a successful mobile application in today's ever-changing market? There are (what seems like an infinite) number of design, build, and test cycles performed, just to release your app into the hands of a user.

In essence:

```swift
  while Users.love != true {
    Product.design()
    Product.rebuild()
  }
```

Once completed, the real challenge begins – retaining those users. Mostly that means getting users to log in to your app easily, and then never have to do it again. With Okta, you can effortlessly integrate authentication into your iOS application with the [Okta AppAuth SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-appauth-ios).

This post will show you how to add [OpenID Connect](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oidc) for user Authentication into your native iOS application, using Swift.

This post also assumes you have the latest version of [XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12), along with Swift 3.x+.

1. Create a new Xcode project
2. [Sign-up](http://synd.co/2yHkGXz) for a free Okta Developer Edition account
3. Log in to your Okta account and select **Applications > Add Application > Native**
4. Update the **Grant type allowed** to include *Refresh Token*
5. Click **Done**
6. Copy the **Login redirect URI** and **Client ID**, as you will need to insert these into your native app configuration

## Install the Okta AppAuth SDK

The [Okta AppAuth SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-appauth-ios) is available through [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/). For instructions on installing [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/), see [their getting started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

From a terminal window, navigate into your iOS application's directory to create a `Podfile`, where `'MyApp'` is the name of your new Xcode project.

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'OktaAuth', '~> 0.1'
end
```

Next, install the SDK by running `pod install`. You should see the following message appear once the installation is completed:
{% img blog/ios-app-secure-auth/pod-install-oktaauth.png alt:"Cocoapods Installation" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }


Open up the newly generated `.xcworkspace` file by running the following in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace 'MyApp' with the name of your iOS application
open MyApp.xcworkspace/
```

## Configure your iOS App

The SDK uses a **Property List** (`.plist`) file to bootstrap the login flow. We will need to create an `Okta.plist` file in your application's bundle, using your newly created Okta application's attributes:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>issuer</key>
	<string>https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default</string>
	<key>clientId</key>
	<string>{clientIdValue}</string>
	<key>redirectUri</key>
	<string>{redirectUrlValue}</string>
        <key>scopes</key>
	<array>
		<string>offline_access</string>
		<string>openid</string>
		<string>profile</string>
	</array>
</dict>
</plist>
```
### OpenID Connect Terminology

| Setting       | Value                                     | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `issuer`      | https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default   | Your organization's URL, appended with your `default` authorization server.                                                                 |
| `clientId`    | `0oac123..`                               | Client ID copied from the **Client Credentials** section on your Okta Application's page.                                                   |
| `redirectUri` | `{yourOktaScheme}:/callback`              | Login redirect URI copied from the **General Settings** section on your Okta Application's page.                                            |
| `scopes`      | `offline_access`, `openid`, and `profile` | Enables your application to receive basic user information via an [ID Token](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken). |

### Update the Private-use URI Scheme

To allow apps to communicate with one another on an iOS device, we need to register a **URI Scheme**.

The easiest way to set this up is to navigate to the **Info** tab under your Application's target. Specify a **URL Scheme** to be your *redirectUri*, excluding the path.

{% img blog/ios-app-secure-auth/url-scheme.png alt:"Update Private-Use URI Scheme" width:"750" %}{: .center-image }

## Add User Authentication
First, we need to handle the inter-app communication between the device's native browser and your application. Open `AppDelegate.swift` and add the following:

```swift
// AppDelegate.swift
import OktaAuth

func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any]) -> Bool {
    return OktaAuth.resume(url, options: options)
}
```

Next, lets add the **login** code! You can trigger a login event a number of ways. For this article, we will simply add the **login** action to run during our initial `viewDidLoad`. Open your `ViewController.swift` file and add the following to start the auth flow:

```swift
import OktaAuth

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        OktaAuth
            .login()
            .start(self) { response, error in
                if error != nil { print(error!) }

                // Success
                if let tokenResponse = response {
                    OktaAuth.tokens?.set(value: tokenResponse.accessToken!, forKey: "accessToken")
                    OktaAuth.tokens?.set(value: tokenResponse.idToken!, forKey: "idToken")
                    print("Success! Received accessToken: \(tokenResponse.accessToken!)")
                    print("Success! Received idToken: \(tokenResponse.idToken!)")
                }
        }
    }
```

### What's Happening?
Once your application loads, it will trigger the `OktaAuth.login()` event. [Best current practice](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-native-apps-12) for native applications suggest initiating the login flow via an in-app browser, instead of an embeddable WebView.

After the user authenticates using the Okta Sign-In Page, some magic happens behind the scenes. Primarily, handling the [Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636#section-1.1). This handshake is abstracted from us by the [Okta AppAuth SDK](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-appauth-ios), and allows us to securely receive the requested tokens.

If there is a successful login event, our application is bounced back to the main page, where we store the `accessToken` and the `idToken` to the device's [Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/keychainServConcepts/02concepts/concepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000897-CH204-TP9) to ensure the tokens are encrypted.

Now, let's see it in action!

## Run your App in the Simulator
To build and run your iOS application, use the Xcode [Simulator](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/simulator_help_topics/Chapter/Chapter.html).
  - Click the ▶️  button on the top-left of your editor.
  - Alternatively, select **Run** under the **Product** toolbar to launch the default simulator.

In a few moments, you should see the Okta Login Page.

{% img blog/ios-app-secure-auth/mobile-signin-view.png alt:"Okta Login Page" height:"600" %}{: .center-image }



Enter your **username** and **password**, then click **Sign In**. Upon successful authentication, you'll be redirected back to your application. Check your debugger to see the following message:

```sh
Success! Received idToken:
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IkdOMlBlRU5seEFISGNjLVJmM0pXcktodGFrT3...
Success! Received accessToken:
eyJhbGc...
```

Copy the `idToken` response and paste it into [jsonwebtoken.io](https://www.jsonwebtoken.io/) to see the information contained within the identity token!

## Request User Information
Courtesy of the OpenID Connect API, we have access to a protected `userinfo` endpoint. During our initial authentication request, we received an `accessToken` and an `idToken`, where an `idToken` is a Json Web Token (JWT) that represents an authenticated user. The `accessToken` is usually an opaque token used specifically for calling and protected API endpoints.

Using the newly minted `accessToken`, lets request more information about the user by calling the `userinfo()` method:

```swift
OktaAuth
    .login()
    .start(self) { response, error in
        if error != nil { print(error!) }

        // Success
        if let tokenResponse = response {
            OktaAuth.tokens?.set(value: tokenResponse.accessToken!, forKey: "accessToken")
            OktaAuth.tokens?.set(value: tokenResponse.idToken!, forKey: "idToken")

            OktaAuth.userinfo() { response, error in
                if error != nil { print("Error: \(error!)") }

                if let userinfo = response {
                    userinfo.forEach { print("\($0): \($1)") }
                }
            }
        }
}
```

▶️  the application again to see what was returned!

## What's Next
Now that you have additional user information, you can store the user's email address, profile image, and more into your application - or use it for personalization. Using Okta's [Universal Directory](https://www.okta.com/products/universal-directory/), you can modify user attributes by navigating to  **Applications** in your Okta Developer Console. Select your new native application, then click on the **Assignments** tab.

Edit the user's profile directly by selecting the *pencil* icon, which will display a modal similar to:

{% img blog/ios-app-secure-auth/user-profile-mapping.png alt:"Okta User Assignment" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

▶️  the application one last time to see your updated user!
