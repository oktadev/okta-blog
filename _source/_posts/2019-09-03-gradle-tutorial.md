In the Java world, there are two main build systems: Gradle and Maven.  A build system chiefly manages potentially complex webs of dependencies and compiles the project. It also packages the compiled project along with all the resources and meta files into the final `.war` or `.jar` file. For simple builds, the choice between Maven and Gradle is pretty much one of personal taste, or perhaps the taste of your CTO or technical manager. They both work great. However, for more complex projects, Gradle is a winner.

## Pros and Cons of Building with Gradle

I personally love Gradle; I hate XML and spent several years working on a large, complex Java/Groovy project that would have been impossible without Gradle. Aside from the lack of XML, Gradle offers flexibility and build speed, using build files written in Groovy or Kotlin. 
With  the full power of Kotlin or Groovy, along with the Gradle API  libraries, you can create build scripts of staggering power and complexity. This can certainly be a blessing and a curse. 

The DSL (domain-specific language) takes some getting used to, and Gradle has a reputation of being hard to learn; however, I think this is mostly because people are already accustomed to Maven. With Gradle, you essentially learn a *build language*, rather than just hacking away at XML. <mark>Using Gradle to its full potential certainly has a much higher learning curve than simply adding a dependency in Maven; but adding a dependency to a Gradle file isn't really any harder than in Maven.</mark> It is much simpler to extend and customize a Gradle build than to write a Maven plugin and customize build steps.

Gradle also shortens build times considerably, especially in larger projects, because it does a great job of only reprocessing tasks and files that have changed. Further, it provides a build cache and a build daemon that make repeated builds more performant. Also, like Maven, it uses parallel threading for dependency resolution and the project build. Again, for a small, simple build, this performance increase is probably not significant. But for larger projects, it's huge.

So, to summarize. Gradle is:
- Faster for large projects
- Infinitely customizable == steeper learning curve
- Uses Groovy or Kotlin instead of XML

While Maven is:
- Tried and true
- Ubiquitous
- Simpler for smaller projects that don't require customization 
- Plagued with XML and angle brackets

## What's Great about Groovy

Just a quick word about Groovy. Groovy is a JVM language, in that it compiles down to the same byte-code as Java and inter-operates seamlessly with Java classes.  Groovy is a backwards compatible superset of Java, meaning that Groovy can transparently interface with Java libraries and code. However, it also adds a ton of new features: optional typing, functional programming, runtime flexibility, and lots of meta-programming stuff. It also greatly cleaned up a lot of Java's wordy, ceremony code. Groovy hasn't taken off as a mainstream development language, largely being overtaken by Scala and Kotlin, but it has found a niche in testing (because of its streamlined syntax and the meta-programming features) and in build systems.

## Dependencies 

You'll need to install a few things for this tutorial (as well as sign up for an Okta account):

**Java:** you probably already have Java installed. This tutorial requires at least Java 1.8. If not, navigate to the [OpenJDK website](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) and install it. You could also install java using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on OSX and Linux using: `brew cask install java`.

**Gradle:** typically with a Gradle build you don't actually have to install it. Gradle provides a feature called the Gradle wrapper that includes a script to download the correct Gradle version to build the project automatically. However, in this tutorial, since it's a tutorial about Gradle, you might go ahead and install it. Just for fun. Gradle can be installed with homebrew, [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/sdks#gradle), or via download. They have [instructions on the Gradle website](https://gradle.org/install/). 

**Okta Developer Account**: for the authentication portion of the sample application, you'll need a free Okta developer account. You'll be using Okta as an OAuth / OIDC (OpenID Connect) provider. If you don't have one, please go to [the Okta sign-up page](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) and sign up. Note: The first time you log in, you'll need to click the **Admin** button to get to the Okta Admin Console.

**HTTPie**: You're going to use a great command line utility to run a few HTTP requests from the command line. If you don't already have it installed, head over to [their website](https://httpie.org/) and install it.

## Download the Sample Project

For the purposes of this tutorial, I've written a simple sample project. It's a basic REST service written using Spring Boot and Java. Spring Boot makes it easy to build a secure Java web application. As an added bonus, I've included JWT authentication using OAuth 2.0 / OIDC (OpenID Connect). The authentication provider used by the project is Okta, a software-as-service identity management provider. You should have already [signed up for a free developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

Please go ahead and download or clone [the example project from the GitHub page](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-gradle-example) and checkout the `start` branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-gradle-example.git -b start
cd okta-spring-boot-gradle-example
```

## Get to Know `build.gradle`

The `build.gradle` file is the core of a Gradle project. It is where the build is configured. It's equivalent to `pom.xml` for Maven (without all the horrible angle brackets - did I mention I was attacked by XML as a young developer and have never gotten over it?)

Let's look at one. This comes from the example project that just downloaded.

```groovy
// 1) configure the requirements to run the build script
buildscript { 
    // set a custom property 
    ext {  
       springBootVersion = '2.1.6.RELEASE'  
    }  
    // check for dependencies in Maven Central when resolving the
    // dependencies in the buildscript block
    repositories {  
       mavenCentral()  
    }  
    // we need the spring boot plugin to run the build script
    dependencies {  
       classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:${springBootVersion}")  
    }  
}  
  
// 2) apply some plugins
apply plugin: 'java'  
apply plugin: 'org.springframework.boot'  
apply plugin: 'io.spring.dependency-management'  
  
// 3) set some standard properties
group = 'com.okta.springboottokenauth'  
version = '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'  
sourceCompatibility = 1.8  
  
// 4) repos to search to resolve dependencies for the project
repositories {  
    mavenCentral()  
}  

// 5) project dependencies
dependencies {  
    implementation( 'com.okta.spring:okta-spring-boot-starter:1.2.1' )  
    implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security')  
    implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web')  
    testImplementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test')  
    testImplementation('org.springframework.security:spring-security-test')  
}
```

The key to understanding a Gradle build file is to realize it's a script, built in a Groovy DSL. Roughly speaking, it's a configuration script that calls a series of closures (think functions, more in a bit on this) that define configuration options. It almost looks like JSON or a property file, and while that's technically very wrong under the hood, it's not that far off as a starting point.

However, the real power comes because `build.gradle` is a Groovy script. Thus it can execute arbitrary code and access any Java library,  build-specific Gradle DSL and the Gradle API. You could probably launch the space shuttle with a Gradle file.

## The Gradle `buildscript`

Let's look at the script from the top down:

1) The `buildscript` closure configures the properties, dependencies, and source repositories required for the build script itself (as opposed to the application).

2) Next, `apply plugin`, shockingly, applies plugins. These extend the basic capability of the Gradle-Groovy DSL framework: the `java` plugin is applied, along with Spring Boot and Spring dependency management. The Java plugin configures Gradle to expect the standard Java project directory structure: `src/main/java`, `src/main/resources`, `src/test/java`, etc. These can be configured to change the default directories or adding new directories. 
The [Gradle Java plugin docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/building_java_projects.html) are a good place to peruse more info.

3) Next, some standard properties are applied to the build. 

4) The `repositories` block defines where the build script will look for dependencies. Maven Central is most common (`mavenCentral()`), but other repositories can be configured as well, including custom and local ones. A local Maven cache can be configured as a repository using `mavenLocal()`. This is helpful if a team wants to coordinate builds between projects but doesn't want to actually tie the project build files together.

5) Finally, the project dependencies are defined. 

The order of the standard, pre-defined closures doesn't matter, since most `build.gradle` files only define dependencies, set project properties, and use predefined tasks, the order of the elements in the file doesn't matter. There is no reason the `repositories` block has to go before the `dependencies` block, for example. You can think of the `build.gradle` file as simply a configuration file that Gradle reads before executing whatever tasks it was assigned by the shell command that called it.

It gets more complicated, however, when you start using the power of Gradle to define custom tasks and perform arbitrary code. Gradle will read the `build.gradle` file in a top-down manner, and execute any code blocks it finds therein; depending on what this code is doing, it could create an enforced ordering in the script. Further, when you define custom tasks and properties (not found in the Gradle API), ordering matters because these symbols will not be pre-defined and as such must be defined in the build script before you can use them.
## What's a Closure?

Back when Groovy first came out, functional programming was pretty niche and bringing things like closures into the JVM felt crazy. These days, it's a lot more common: every function in Javascript is a closure. Generally speaking, a closure is a first-class function with a scope bound to it.

This means two things:
1. Closures are functions that can be passed as variables at runtime
2. Closures retain access to the variable scope where they are defined

The Java version of a closure is called a lambda. These were introduced into Java with version 1.8, not incidentally this happened around the same time Groovy was gaining initial popularity and functional programming was taking off.

 To demonstrate a lambda, take a look at the JUnit test named `LambdaTest.java`.
 
`src/test/java/com/okta/springboottokenauth/LambdaTest.java`

```java
interface SimpleLambda {  
    public int sum(int x, int y);  
}  
  
public class LambdaTest {  
  
    // create a lambda function with an var  
    // encapsulated in its scope  
    public SimpleLambda getTheLambda(int offset) {  
        int scopedVar = offset;  
        return (int x, int y) -> x + y + scopedVar;  
    }  
  
    @Test  
    public void testClosure() {  
        // get and test a lambda/closure with offset = 1  
        SimpleLambda lambda1 = getTheLambda(1);  
        assertEquals(lambda1.sum(2,2), 5);  
  
        // get and test a lambda/closure with offset = 2  
        SimpleLambda lambda2 = getTheLambda(2);  
        assertEquals(lambda2.sum(2,2), 6);  
    }
}
```

This example is a bit contrived, but demonstrates the two basic properties of lambdas. In the closure, or lambda function, implementation is defined in the `getTheLambda(int offset)` method. The lambda is created with the offset variable encapsulated in the closure scope and returned. This lambda is assigned to a variable. It can be called repeatedly, and it will reference the same scope. Further, *a new lambda can be created with a new offset variable encapsulated in a separate scope* and assigned to a different variable.

Coming from a strong object-oriented background, closures initially felt like wormholes being punched through the strict object-scope continuum, strangely connecting various parts of object over space and time.

## Gradle is Nothing But Closures

Take the dependencies section of the `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {  
    implementation( 'com.okta.spring:okta-spring-boot-starter:1.2.1' )  
    implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security')  
    ...
}
```

Without the Groovy DSL shorthand, this is actually:

```groovy
project.dependencies({
    implementation( 'com.okta.spring:okta-spring-boot-starter:1.2.1' )  
    implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security')  
    ... 
})
```

Everything in the brackets is actually a closure passed to the `project.dependencies()` method. The `project` object is an instance of the `Project` class, the main API parent class for the build.

As you can see, these functions pass in a series of dependencies as strings. So why not just use a more traditional static data structure like JSON, properties, or XML? Because these overloaded functions can accept closure code blocks as well, allowing for deep customization. 

The definition of this block from the [docs for the Project class on the Gradle website](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.Project.html#org.gradle.api.Project:dependencies%28groovy.lang.Closure%29):

>#### `dependencies`  { }
>
>Configures the dependencies for this project.
>
>This method executes the given closure against the  [`DependencyHandler`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler.html)  for this project. The  [`DependencyHandler`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler.html)  is passed to the closure as the closure's delegate.

We don't need to get too deep into Groovy closures, but the delegate object mentioned above is an assignable context object. It's used like the Javascript binding `this` , but here the delegate is a separate, assignable variable that leaves the actual execution scope untouched and accessible.

## Exploring Gradle Dependency Configurations

Inside the dependency block are a sequence of configurations and names.

```groovy
dependencies {
    configurationName dependencyNotation
}
```

Our `build.gradle` file uses two configurations: `implementation` and `testImplementation`.

`implementation()` defines a dependency required at compile time. This configuration method was called `compile`. `testImplementation()` and defined a dependency required for testing only (the old `testCompile`).

Another dependency configuration you'll likely see is `runtimeOnly` and `testRuntimeOnly`. This declares dependencies provided at runtime that do not need to be compiled against.

There are more ways to define dependencies than is useful for the scope of this article. Suffice to say just about anything can be a dependency: a local file, a directory of jars, another Gradle project, etc..., and dependencies can be configured to do things like exclude certain sub-dependencies. 

Worth noting: Gradle and Maven do not resolve dependencies in exactly the same way. You can have the same set of dependencies in a Maven project and a Gradle project, and end up with dependency problems in one and not in the other.

For example, say we wanted to exclude the Log4j dependency from the Okta Spring Boot Starter, we could do this:

```groovy
dependencies {  
    implementation( 'com.okta.spring:okta-spring-boot-starter:1.2.1' ) {
        exclude group: 'org.apache.logging.log4j', module: 'log4j-api'
    }
}
```

Or say we wanted to include all the files in the `libs` directory as dependencies:

```groovy
dependencies {  
    implementation fileTree('libs')
}
```

The full notation is documented on [the Gradle docs site for the DependencyHandler](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler.html) and in [the Gradle docs for the Java plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html).

## Wrapping A Gradle Build

One awesome thing about Gradle is the Gradle Wrapper. The Gradle command line is `gradle`. However, you'll notice that in a lot of places online, you'll see `./gradlew` or `gradlew.bat`. These are commands that invoke the wrapper.

The wrapper allows a project to bundle the Gradle version necessary to build the project **inside** the project itself. This guarantees that changes to Gradle will not break the build because the correct version will always be available as well. It also ensures that people can run the build even if they do not have Gradle installed.

It adds the following files to your project:
```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gradle
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wrapper
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gradle-wrapper.jar
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gradle-wrapper.properties
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gradlew
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gradlew.bat
```

The `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` are execution scripts for Linux/OSX and Window (respectively). They run the `build.gradle` file using the bundled Gradle `.jar` in the `gradle/wrapper` subdirectory.

This project was wrapped with Gradle version 5.5 and if you installed Gradle as suggested, you could likely run this project without a problem. However, you could just as easily do this entire tutorial using the wrapper.

## Tasks, Tasks, and More Tasks

Tasks are at the core of Gradle. The Java plugin adds a dozen tasks, including: `clean`, `compile`, `test`, `jar`, and `uploadArchives`. The Spring Boot plugin adds the `bootRun` task, which runs the Spring Boot application.

Generally a task is run like this: `gradle taskName otherTaskName`, or using the wrapper: `./gradlew taskName otherTaskName`.

If you open a terminal and `cd` to the base directory of the example project, you can use `gradle tasks` to list all of the tasks defined by the `build.gradle` file. `tasks` is, of course, itself a task defined by the base Gradle API.

``` txt
> Task :tasks

...
```

I want to point out the `dependencies` task. It will list a tree with all dependencies (including sub-dependencies) required by the project. Try running `gradle dependencies` in the project root directory. You can drill down into a specific sub dependency using the `dependencyInsight` task.

Another helpful task for troubleshooting is the `properties` task, which lists all of the properties defined on the root project object instance.

Of course, when developing Spring Boot projects, 9 times out of 10, the command I use is: `./gradlew bootJar`. This is a task added by the Spring Boot Gradle plugin that packages the project and it's dependencies in a single jar file.

## Creating Custom Tasks

Open your `build.gradle` file and add the following at the end: 

```groovy
println "1"  
  
task howdy {  
    println "2"  
    doLast {  
        println "Howdy"  
    }  
}  
  
println "3"
```

This will demonstrate a little about how Gradle scripts work. Run it with:

```bash
./gradlew howdy
``` 

You'll see (with some extraneous lines omitted):

```bash
> Configure project :
1
2
3

> Task :howdy
Howdy
```

Here the `Configure project` task builds and runs the build script. As Gradle executes the `Configure project` task, it does the following:
- It hits the first `println` and prints "1"
- It finds the `howdy` task definition block, a closure, which it executes, and prints "2". Notice that it **does not** execute the `doLast` closure, so it does not yet print "A".
- It continues down the script, hitting the fourth `println`, and prints "3".

At this point, the build script itself has finished configuring the build environment. The next step is to execute any tasks specified on the command line, in our case the`howdy` task. 

This is where the `task.doLast {}` block gets executed, and thus you see "Howdy" printed in the output.

`doLast` is a misnomer for that block;what it really means it something like "task action", while the outer block is task setup and configuration. See below.

```groovy
task howdy {  
    // always executed at during initial build script configuration
    doLast {  
        // only executed if task itself is invoked  
    }
    // always executed at during initial build script configuration  
}  
```

The various ways of defining tasks according to [the Gradle docs using the Groovy DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.Task.html) are as follows:

```
task taskName
task taskName { configure closure }
task taskName(type: SomeType)
task taskName(type: SomeType) { configure closure }
```

Just to hammer this home, the "configure closure" is **executed immediately** when the build script runs and the `doLast` closure defined in the configure closure executes when the task is specifically performed.

Add a second custom task to the `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
task partner {  
    println "4"  
    doLast {  
        println "Partner"  
    }  
}  
println "5"
```

If you `./gradlew partner`, you'll see:

```txt
> Configure project :
1
2
3
4
5

> Task :partner
Partner
```

What if you want one custom task to depend on another? It's easy. Add the following line somewhere in your `build.gradle` file after the definition of the two custom tasks.

```
partner.dependsOn howdy
```

And run: `./gradlew partner`

```txt
...
> Task :howdy
Howdy

> Task :partner
Partner
```

You could also have expressed a similar relationship using the task property `finalizedBy`. If you replace the `dependsOn` line with:
```
howdy.finalizedBy partner
```
And run: `/gradlew howdy`. 

```txt
...
> Task :howdy
Howdy

> Task :partner
Partner
```
Bam! Howdy partner.

You get the same output. Of course, they express different relationships. 

There are a TON of options. This is partly where Gradle's reputation for being confusing comes from. The [Gradle docs for the Task API](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.Task.html) are a great reference.

One last point about tasks: in practice you rarely write custom tasks to say things like "Howdy Partner" (hard to believe, I know). In fact, typically you override an already defined task types. For example, Gradle defines a `Copy` task that copies files from one place to another.

Here's an example that copies docs into the build target:

```groovy
task copyDocs(type: Copy) {
    from 'src/main/doc'
    into 'build/target/doc'
}
```

The real power of Groovy and Gradle comes in when you realize that because the `build.gradle` file is actually a Groovy script, you can essentially execute arbitrary code to filter and transform these files, if you need to. 

The task below transforms each copies file and excludes `.DS_Store` files. The DSL is super flexible. You can have multiple `from` blocks and `excludes`, or do things like rename files or specifically include files instead. Again, peek at [the docs for the Copy task](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.Copy.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.Copy) to get a fuller idea.

```groovy
task copyDocs(type: Copy) {
    from 'src/main/doc'
    into 'build/target/doc'
    eachFile { file ->
	    doSomething(file);
    }
    exclude '**/.DS_Store'
}
```

The task I override the most in Gradle `Jar` or `War`, the tasks responsible for packaging the `.jar` and `.war` files for final distribution. Like the `Copy` task, they have a very open-ended ability to customize the process, which can be a **huge** help on projects that require a customized final product. You can essentially use the Gradle DSL to totally control all aspects of the packaging process. (With great power comes great responsibility, of course).

The Spring Boot plugin's `bootJar` and `bootWar` tasks inherit from the `Jar` and `War` tasks, so they include all of their configuration options, including the ability to copy, filter, and modify files, as well as the ability to customize the manifest.

## Create an OIDC Application

Now that you're an advanced Gradle ninja (or, at least, hopefully, not intimidated by the Gradle DSL), it's time to go back to the original Spring Boot project.

{% include setup/cli.md type="web" signup="false" 
   loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta,https://oidcdebugger.com/debug"
   logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080" %}

Take note of your **issuer** and **client ID**. You'll need it in a moment to generate a JWT.

## Update the Spring Boot App

You need to make a few changes to the Spring Boot app. First, remove all of the `Howdy Partner` stuff from the `build.gradle` file, if you want. It doesn't actually hurt anything, but it's not necessary anymore.

Add the following closure to the bottom of the `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
processResources {  
    expand(project.properties)  
}
``` 

This configures the `Java` task to expand the project properties into the resource files.

If you take a look at the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file:

```yaml
okta:  
  oauth2:  
    issuer: ${oauthIssuer}  
```

You'll notice that there are two properties that we want to fill in. The best way to do this is with a `gradle.properties` file. 

Create a `gradle.properties` file in the project root:

```properties
oauthIssuer={yourIssuerUri}
```

You need to replace `{yourIssuerUri}` with your Okta issuer. 

## Generate a Token Using OIDC Debugger

{% include setup/oidcdebugger.md %}

{% img blog/gradle-tutorial/oidc-debugger.png alt:"Configure the OIDC Debugger" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Scroll down and click **Send Request**.

You should see the success screen.

{% img blog/gradle-tutorial/oidc-debugger-token.png alt:"OIDC Debugger returns a token" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Copy the access token, open a terminal, and store it in a shell variable like this:

```bash
export TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJxMm5rZmtwUDRhMlJLV2REU2JfQ09LTlFD...
```

## Run a Request Using the Token

The Spring Boot app defines one controller: `HelloController.java`:

```java
// ...
  
@RestController
public class HelloController {  The Spring Boot app defines one contr
  
    // REQUIRES AUTHENTICATION  
    @RequestMapping("/")  
    public String home(java.security.Principal user) {  
        return "Hello " + user.getName() + "!";  
    }  
    
    // DOES NOT REQUIRE AUTHENTICATION  
    @RequestMapping("/allow-anonymous")  
    public String anonymous() {  
        return "Hello whoever!";  
    } 
}
```

There are two endpoints. Although it's not obvious from the controller file itself, the `/` endpoint requires authentication and the `/allow-anonymous` endpoint does not. The configuration for this happens in the `Application.java` file, in the `configure(HttpSecurity http)` method. I'm glossing over the specifics of Spring Boot here because this isn't the focus of this tutorial and is well covered in other blog posts (see the links at the end).

From a separate shell (not the one you just saved the `TOKEN` var in), run the Spring Boot app using:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

Back in the shell with the `TOKEN` var, run an HTTP request including the JWT:

```bash
http :8080 "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

You'll get an HTTP 200:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
...

Hello andrew.hughes@example.com!
```
Success!

You can run a request without the JWT to see that auth is required:

```bash
http :8080 
```

```bash
HTTP/1.1 401
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Content-Length: 0
...
```

For more detail on the Spring Boot app and authentication/authorization, check out the links at the end for more blog posts.

The next step is to write a couple tests and run them with Gradle.

## Test the Code

Create a test file:
`src/test/java/com/okta/springbootgradle/HelloControllerTest.java`

```java
package com.okta.springbootgradle;  
  
import org.junit.Test;  
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;  
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;  
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.AutoConfigureMockMvc;  
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;  
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment;  
import org.springframework.boot.web.server.LocalServerPort;  
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;  
import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc;  
  
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.containsString;  
import static org.springframework.security.test.web.servlet.request.SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.user;  
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.get;  
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultHandlers.print;  
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.content;  
import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.status;  
  
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)  
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT, properties = {"okta.oauth2.issuer=https://oauth.example.com/oauth2/default"})  
@AutoConfigureMockMvc  
public class HelloControllerTest {  
  
    @LocalServerPort  
    private int port;  
  
    @Autowired  
    private MockMvc mockMvc;  
      
    // test for auth required on home endpoine
    @Test  
    public void homeShouldFail() throws Exception {  
        this.mockMvc  
            .perform(get("/"))  
            .andDo(print())  
            .andExpect(status().isUnauthorized());  
    } 
    
    // test home endpoint with auth
    @Test  
    public void homeShouldPass() throws Exception {  
        this.mockMvc  
            .perform(get("/").with(user("Mister Tester")))  
            .andDo(print())  
            .andExpect(status().isOk())  
            .andExpect(content().string(containsString("Hello Mister Tester!")));  
    }  
      
    // test anonymous endpoint
    @Test  
    public void anonymous() throws Exception {  
        this.mockMvc  
            .perform(get("/allow-anonymous"))  
            .andDo(print())  
            .andExpect(status().isOk())  
            .andExpect(content().string(containsString("Hello whoever!")));;  
    } 
}
```

This test file has three tests. The first test checks the home endpoint to ensure that a request that does not supply authentication fails with an unauthorized error. The second test uses the Spring MockMVC library to supply authentication and tests the home endpoint again. The last test checks the `/allow-anonymous` endpoint.

Run the tests with: `./gradlew test`

The output is pretty minimal:

```txt
> Task :test
INFO [Thread-6] o.s.s.c.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor : Shutting down ExecutorService 'applicationTaskExecutor'

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 7s
5 actionable tasks: 5 executed
```

If you'd like to see more info, try adding the `-i` flag, like so:

```bash
./gradlew test -i
```

Testing with Spring is a whole tutorial in itself, so I'll leave it at that. [Spring's nice guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/testing-web/) introduces some different ways to test Spring Boot REST services.

I would never, ever condone this, but if you need to run a build and want to skip the tests, you can use: `gradle build -x test`.

Like all things Gradle, the `Test` task is highly customizable. You can set test-specific system properties, configure JVM args, change heap sizes, include or exclude specifics tests, etc... Take a look at [the docs for the Test task ](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html) on the Gradle page.

You can also check out the final state of the project on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-gradle-example) on the `main` branch.

## Wrapping Up

In this tutorial you learned the basics of the Gradle build system. You saw that Gradle is super flexible and customizable and can be used with a Groovy DSL or Kotlin DSL. You looked at the sample `build.gradle` file in the tutorial project and saw how a typical build is configured. Next, the tutorial dove into the world of closures and saw how they are used in the Gradle DSL to create configuration blocks. After that, you used the Gradle wrapper to encapsulate the project build system within the project itself and then dove into Gradle tasks, creating custom tasks and looking how tasks are processed and executed. And there's more! Haha. The tutorial then showed you how to build and run a simple Spring Boot project using Gradle, and how to define and run a few tests using Spring and Gradle.
