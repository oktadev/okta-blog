I'm embarking on a new adventure and entering the wide world of Developer Advocacy at Okta! Much like [Kiki setting out on her journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki%27s_Delivery_Service#Plot), I'm full of enthusiasm and curiosity and am ready to fly. I'm thrilled to be here at Okta and looking forward to everything. Now, I just need to get a talking cat...

I'm a military brat who grew up in Japan and then moved to Kansas City. When I'm not diving deep into technical docs or hacking on a project, I love engaging with dev communities and relaxing at home. You might find me sharing knowledge as a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts) in Angular, organizing [ngGirls](https://www.ng-girls.org/) workshops as a core team member, co-organizing [AngularKC meetups](https://www.meetup.com/angularkc/), or creating a curriculum for women to learn web development skills at [Coding & Cocktails](https://codingandcocktails.kcwomenintech.org/). You might also find me leaning into my homebody ways by reading, enjoying a glass of wine, playing word puzzle games, or watching K-Dramas. Oh, and yes, I do love watching [Studio Ghibli](https://www.ghibli.jp/) films.

My professional technical background is over ten years of enterprise software development working on B2B products in various languages, from C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript. From image rendering to creating web services and APIs to implementing event orchestration to developing mobile-friendly web apps, I've had an opportunity to learn a lot. But I took a shine to all things JavaScript. Of course, I love [Angular](https://angular.io) and am also excited about both front-end and back-end JavaScript frameworks. It's incredible what we can create with code, and I am always in awe of all the innovations in software development! We, as devs, are pretty magical! ✨
