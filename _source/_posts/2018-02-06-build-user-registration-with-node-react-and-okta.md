Today's internet users expect a personalized experience. Developers must learn to develop websites that provide that personalized experience while keeping their user's information private. Modern web applications also tend to have a server-side API and a client-side user interface. it can be challenging to get make both ends aware of the currently logged in user. In this tutorial, I will walk you through setting up a Node API that feeds a React UI, and build a user registration that keeps the user's information private and personal.

In this tutorial, I won't use any state management libraries like Redux or ReduxThunk. In a more robust application, you'll probably want to do that, but it will be easy to wire up Redux and ReduxThunk and then add the `fetch` statements used here as your thunks. For the sake of simplicity, and to keep this article focused on adding user management, I'll be adding fetch statements into `componentDidMount` functions.

## Install the Node and React Prerequisites

To set up the base application, make sure you have these basic tools installed:

- Node (8+)
- npm (5+)
- create-react-app (npm package)
- express-generator (npm package)

You'll also need an [Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

To install Node and npm, you can follow the instructions for your operating system at <https://nodejs.org/en/>.

Then just install the two npm packages with the npm command line:

```bash
npm i -g create-react-app express-generator
```

Now you're ready to set up the basic application structure.

## Scaffold the Base Application

Go to the folder where you want your application to live and create a new folder for it:

```bash
mkdir MembershipSample
cd MembershipSample
express api
create-react-app client
```

This will create two folders in the `MembershipSample` folder called `api` and `client`, with a NodeJS and Express application in the `api` folder and a base React application in the `client` folder. So your folder structure will look like:

- MembershipSample
  - api
  - client

To make this next part easier, open two terminals or terminal tabs; one to the express app folder `api` and the other to the React app folder `client`.

By default, the React app and the Node app will both run on port 3000 in development, so you'll need to get the API to run on a different port and then proxy it in the client app.

In the `api` folder, open the `/bin/www` file and change the port the API will be running on to `3001`.

```js
/**
 * Get port from environment and store in Express.
 */

var port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '3001');
app.set('port', port);
```

Then set up the proxy for the API in the client application so that you can still call `/api/{resource}` and have it proxied from port 3000 to port 3001. In the `client/package.json` file, add the `proxy` setting below `name`:

```js
"name": "client",
"proxy": "http://localhost:3001"
```

Lastly, don't forget to run `npm install` or `yarn install` for each subfolder (`api` and `client`) to ensure that the dependencies are installed.

You can now run both applications by running `npm start` or `yarn start` in the appropriate folders for the API and the client application.

## Add an Okta Application

If you haven't already done so, create a free forever developer account at <https://developer.okta.com/signup/>.

Once you've registered, click on **Applications** in the top menu. Then click the **Add Application** button.

{% img blog/build-user-registration-with-node-react-and-okta/application-listing-screen.png alt:"application listing screen" %}{: .center-image }

You will then be taken to the application creation wizard. Choose the **Single-Page App** button and click **Next** at the bottom.

{% img blog/build-user-registration-with-node-react-and-okta/single-page-app-screen.png alt:"single page app screen" %}{: .center-image }

On the next screen, you will see the default settings provided by the single-page application template. Change the name of the application to something more descriptive, like "Membership Application". Also, change the base URIs and the login redirect URIs settings to use port 3000 because that is where your application will be running. The rest of the default settings are fine.

{% img blog/build-user-registration-with-node-react-and-okta/single-page-app-settings-screen.png alt:"single page app settings screen" %}{: .center-image }

Then click the **Done** button at the bottom.

Once the application has been created, select it from the applications listing, and click on the **General** tab to view the general settings for your application.

{% img blog/build-user-registration-with-node-react-and-okta/general-settings-tab.png alt:"general settings tab" %}{: .center-image }

At the bottom, you will see a **Client ID** setting (yours won't be blurred out, obviously). Copy this to use in your React application. You will also need your Okta organization URL, which you can find at the top right of the Dashboard page.

## Enable Self-Service Registration in Your Okta Application
The last piece of setup you need to complete is to enable user registration functionality for the authorization server. Typically, authorization servers only support login, logout, and stuff like that. But Okta's authorization server also supports self-service registration, so that users can create accounts, log into them, reset passwords, and basically do everything without you writing any code for it.

In your Okta dashboard, you'll notice a small button labeled < > **Developer Console** at the top-left of your page. Hover over that button and select the **Classic UI** menu option that appears.

{% img blog/build-user-registration-with-node-react-and-okta/dashboard-classic-ui.png alt:"Dashboard Classic UI" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Next, hover over the **Directory** tab at the top of the page then select the **Self-Service Registration** menu item. On this page click the **Enable Registration** button.

{% img blog/build-user-registration-with-node-react-and-okta/okta-enable-self-service-registration-page.png alt:"Okta Self-Service Registration Page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

On the configuration page, leave all the settings as their default values, except for two:

- Disable the **User must verify email address** to be activated. checkbox. This setting removes the requirement for new users to verify their email address before being allowed to access your web app.
- Set the **Default redirect** option by clicking the **Custom URL** radio box and entering http://localhost:3000/dashboard as the value. This setting tells the authorization server where to redirect users after they've successfully created a new account on your site.
Once you've clicked **Save**, the last thing you need to is switch back to the developer console.

{% img blog/build-user-registration-with-node-react-and-okta/okta-self-service-registration-settings-page.png alt:"Okta enable self-service registration settings page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Hover over the **Classic UI** button at the top right of the page and select the < > **Developer Console** menu item from the drop-down.

## Add Authentication to the ReactJS Application

Now that the application is created, add authentication using Okta by adding a couple of npm dependencies. From the `client` folder run:

```bash
npm install @okta/okta-react@1.2.3 react-router-dom@5.0.1 --save
```

Or, if you're using the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) package manager:

```bash
yarn add @okta/okta-react@1.2.3 react-router-dom@5.0.1
```

Add a file to the `client/src` folder called` app.config.js`. The contents of the file are:

```js
export default {
  url: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}',
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  redirect_uri: window.location.origin + '/implicit/callback',
  client_id: '{clientId}'
};
```

Then, setup the `src/index.js` file to use the React Router and Okta's React SDK. When the `index.js` file is complete, it will look like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Security } from '@okta/okta-react';

import './index.css';
import config from './app.config';
import App from './App';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

function onAuthRequired({ history }) {
  history.push('/login');
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <Security
      issuer={config.issuer}
      client_id={config.client_id}
      redirect_uri={config.redirect_uri}
      onAuthRequired={onAuthRequired}
    >
      <App />
    </Security>
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();
```

Once complete, you will have added the `BrowserRouter` component (aliased as "Router") from the React Router, and the `Security` component from Okta's React SDK. Also that the `app.config.js` file is imported as "config" so that you can use the config values in the properties required by the `Security` component.

You will also have surrounded the `App` component with the `Router` and `Security` components, passing in the values specified. The `onAuthRequired` method, simply tells Okta's React SDK that when somebody tries to access a secure route and they are not logged in, redirect them to the login page.

Everything else will have come from the `create-react-app` command you ran previously.

## Add Pages to the ReactJS App

Before adding any routes to the React app, create some components to handle the routes you want to add.

Add a `components` folder to the `client/src` folder. This is where all your components will live and the easiest way to organize them. Then create a `home` folder for your home page components. For now there will be just one, but there may be more components used only for the home page later. Add a `HomePage.js` file to the folder with the following contents:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default class HomePage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Home Page</h1>;
  }
}
```

This is all you really need for the home page at the moment. The most important point is to make the HomePage component a class type. Even though right now it only contains a single `h1` tag, it is meant to be a "page", meaning it will likely contain other components, so it's important that it be a container component.

Next, create an `auth` folder in `components`. This is where all components that have to do with authentication will live. In that folder, create a `LoginForm.js` file.

The first thing to note is that you'll be using the `withAuth` higher-order component from Okta's React SDK to wrap the entire login form. This adds a prop to the component called `auth`, making it possible to access things like the `isAuthenticated` and `redirect` functions on that higher-order component.

The code for the `LoginForm` component is as follows:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import OktaAuth from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { withAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

export default withAuth(
  class LoginForm extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        sessionToken: null,
        error: null,
        username: '',
        password: ''
      };

      this.oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({ url: props.baseUrl });

      this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
      this.handleUsernameChange = this.handleUsernameChange.bind(this);
      this.handlePasswordChange = this.handlePasswordChange.bind(this);
    }

    handleSubmit(e) {
      e.preventDefault();
      this.oktaAuth
        .signIn({
          username: this.state.username,
          password: this.state.password
        })
        .then(res =>
          this.setState({
            sessionToken: res.sessionToken
          })
        )
        .catch(err => {
          this.setState({ error: err.message });
          console.log(err.statusCode + ' error', err);
        });
    }

    handleUsernameChange(e) {
      this.setState({ username: e.target.value });
    }

    handlePasswordChange(e) {
      this.setState({ password: e.target.value });
    }

    render() {
      if (this.state.sessionToken) {
        this.props.auth.redirect({ sessionToken: this.state.sessionToken });
        return null;
      }

      const errorMessage = this.state.error ? (
        <span className="error-message">{this.state.error}</span>
      ) : null;

      return (
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          {errorMessage}
          <div className="form-element">
            <label>Username:</label>
            <input
              id="username"
              type="text"
              value={this.state.username}
              onChange={this.handleUsernameChange}
            />
          </div>

          <div className="form-element">
            <label>Password:</label>
            <input
              id="password"
              type="password"
              value={this.state.password}
              onChange={this.handlePasswordChange}
            />
          </div>
          <input id="submit" type="submit" value="Submit" />
        </form>
      );
    }
  }
);
```

The other thing of note here is the `OktaAuth` library being imported. This is the base library for doing things like signing in using the Okta application you created previously. You'll notice an `OktaAuth` object being created in the constructor that gets a property of `baseUrl` passed to it. This is the URL for the issuer that is in your `app.config.js` file. The `LoginForm` component is meant to be contained in another component, so you'll have to create a `LoginPage.js` file to contain this component. You'll use the `withAuth` higher-order component again, to get access to the `isAuthenticated` function. The contents of `LoginPage.js` will be:

{% raw %}
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
import LoginForm from './LoginForm';
import { withAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

export default withAuth(class Login extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { authenticated: null };
    this.checkAuthentication = this.checkAuthentication.bind(this);
    this.checkAuthentication();
  }

  async checkAuthentication() {
    const authenticated = await this.props.auth.isAuthenticated();
    if (authenticated !== this.state.authenticated) {
      this.setState({ authenticated });
    }
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    this.checkAuthentication();
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.authenticated === null) return null;
    return this.state.authenticated ?
      <Redirect to={{ pathname: '/profile' }} /> :
      <LoginForm baseUrl={this.props.baseUrl} />;
  }
});
```
{% endraw %}

Although it's a bit less than what's in the login form component, there are still some important pieces to point out here.

Again, you're using the `withAuth` higher-order component. This will be a recurring theme for every component that needs to use Okta's authentication or authorization process. In this case, it's primarily used to get the `isAuthenticated` function. The `checkAuthentication()` method is executed in the constructor and in the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method to ensure that when the component is created it is checked and every subsequent change to the component checks again.

When `isAuthenticated` returns true, then it is set in the component's state. It is then checked in the render method to decide whether to show the `LoginForm` component, or to redirect to the user's profile page, a component you'll create next.

Now create the `ProfilePage.js` component inside the `auth` folder. The contents of the component are:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { withAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

export default withAuth(
  class ProfilePage extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = { user: null };
      this.getCurrentUser = this.getCurrentUser.bind(this);
    }

    async getCurrentUser() {
      this.props.auth.getUser().then(user => this.setState({ user }));
    }

    componentDidMount() {
      this.getCurrentUser();
    }

    render() {
      if (!this.state.user) return null;
      return (
        <section className="user-profile">
          <h1>User Profile</h1>
          <div>
            <label>Name:</label>
            <span>{this.state.user.name}</span>
          </div>
        </section>
      );
    }
  }
);
```

The `withAuth` component here gives you access to the `getUser` function. Here, it's been called from `componentDidMount` which is a common place for pulling data that will be used in the `render` method. The only odd thing you might see is the first line of the `render` method that renders nothing until there is actually a user returned from the `getUser` asynchronous call. Once there is a user in the state, it then renders the profile content, which in this case is just displaying the currently logged in user's name.

Next, you'll add a registration component. This could be done just like the login form, where there is a `LoginForm` component that is contained in a `LoginPage` component. In order to demonstrate another way to display this, you'll just create a `RegistrationForm` component that will be the main container component. Create a `RegistrationForm.js` file in the `auth` folder with the following content:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import OktaAuth from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { withAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

import config from '../../app.config';

export default withAuth(
  class RegistrationForm extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        firstName: '',
        lastName: '',
        email: '',
        password: '',
        sessionToken: null
      };
      this.oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({ url: config.url });
      this.checkAuthentication = this.checkAuthentication.bind(this);
      this.checkAuthentication();

      this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
      this.handleFirstNameChange = this.handleFirstNameChange.bind(this);
      this.handleLastNameChange = this.handleLastNameChange.bind(this);
      this.handleEmailChange = this.handleEmailChange.bind(this);
      this.handlePasswordChange = this.handlePasswordChange.bind(this);
    }

    async checkAuthentication() {
      const sessionToken = await this.props.auth.getIdToken();
      if (sessionToken) {
        this.setState({ sessionToken });
      }
    }

    componentDidUpdate() {
      this.checkAuthentication();
    }

    handleFirstNameChange(e) {
      this.setState({ firstName: e.target.value });
    }
    handleLastNameChange(e) {
      this.setState({ lastName: e.target.value });
    }
    handleEmailChange(e) {
      this.setState({ email: e.target.value });
    }
    handlePasswordChange(e) {
      this.setState({ password: e.target.value });
    }

    handleSubmit(e) {
      e.preventDefault();
      fetch('/api/users', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          Accept: 'application/json',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(this.state)
      })
        .then(user => {
          this.oktaAuth
            .signIn({
              username: this.state.email,
              password: this.state.password
            })
            .then(res =>
              this.setState({
                sessionToken: res.sessionToken
              })
            );
        })
        .catch(err => console.log);
    }

    render() {
      if (this.state.sessionToken) {
        this.props.auth.redirect({ sessionToken: this.state.sessionToken });
        return null;
      }

      return (
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          <div className="form-element">
            <label>Email:</label>
            <input
              type="email"
              id="email"
              value={this.state.email}
              onChange={this.handleEmailChange}
            />
          </div>
          <div className="form-element">
            <label>First Name:</label>
            <input
              type="text"
              id="firstName"
              value={this.state.firstName}
              onChange={this.handleFirstNameChange}
            />
          </div>
          <div className="form-element">
            <label>Last Name:</label>
            <input
              type="text"
              id="lastName"
              value={this.state.lastName}
              onChange={this.handleLastNameChange}
            />
          </div>
          <div className="form-element">
            <label>Password:</label>
            <input
              type="password"
              id="password"
              value={this.state.password}
              onChange={this.handlePasswordChange}
            />
          </div>
          <input type="submit" id="submit" value="Register" />
        </form>
      );
    }
  }
);
```

This component looks a lot like the `LoginForm` component with the exception that it calls the Node API (that you'll build in a moment) that will handle doing the registration. Once the registration is completed by the Node API, the component logs the newly created user in, and the render method (when it sees a session token in the state) redirects the user to the home page of the application.

You may also notice the `sessionToken` property on the component's state. This is set by the `handleSubmit()` function for the purpose of handling the login if the registration is successful. Then it is also used by the `render()` method to do the redirect once the login has completed, and a token has been received.

## Add Routes to the React App

First, add a navigation component for the routes you'll be adding. In the `client/src/components` folder, add a folder called `shared`. This will be the place where all components that are used in several places in the application will be located. In that new folder, add a file called `Navigation.js`. The file contains a basic component with links to all the pages in the app.

You'll need to wrap the navigation component in the `withAuth` higher-order component. That way, you can check to see if there is an authenticated user and display the login or logout button as appropriate.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { withAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

export default withAuth(
  class Navigation extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = { authenticated: null };
      this.checkAuthentication = this.checkAuthentication.bind(this);
      this.checkAuthentication();
    }

    async checkAuthentication() {
      const authenticated = await this.props.auth.isAuthenticated();
      if (authenticated !== this.state.authenticated) {
        this.setState({ authenticated });
      }
    }

    componentDidUpdate() {
      this.checkAuthentication();
    }

    render() {
      if (this.state.authenticated === null) return null;
      const authNav = this.state.authenticated ? (
        <ul className="auth-nav">
          <li>
            <a
              href="javascript:void(0)"
              onClick={() => this.props.auth.logout()}
            >
              Logout
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to="/profile">Profile</Link>
          </li>
        </ul>
      ) : (
        <ul className="auth-nav">
          <li>
            <a
              href="javascript:void(0)"
              onClick={() => this.props.auth.login()}
            >
              Login
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to="/register">Register</Link>
          </li>
        </ul>
      );
      return (
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            </li>
            {authNav}
          </ul>
        </nav>
      );
    }
  }
);
```

Now that you have components available to handle all the routes, create the routes to go with them. Update the `App.js` file so that the final version looks like:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { SecureRoute, ImplicitCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';

import Navigation from './components/shared/Navigation';
import HomePage from './components/home/HomePage';
import RegistrationForm from './components/auth/RegistrationForm';
import config from './app.config';
import LoginPage from './components/auth/LoginPage';
import ProfilePage from './components/auth/ProfilePage';
import './App.css';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Navigation />
        <main>
          <Route path="/" exact component={HomePage} />
          <Route
            path="/login"
            render={() => <LoginPage baseUrl={config.url} />}
          />
          <Route path="/implicit/callback" component={ImplicitCallback} />
          <Route path="/register" component={RegistrationForm} />
          <SecureRoute path="/profile" component={ProfilePage} />
        </main>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

There are a couple of things of note here. The import of the `SecureRoute` and `ImplicitCallback` components from Okta's React SDK. The `ImplicitCallback` component handles the callback from the authentication flow to ensure there is an endpoint within the React application to catch the return call from Okta. The `SecureRoute` component allows you to secure any route and redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

The `Route` component from React Router does exactly what you'd expect: it takes a path that the user has navigated to and sets a component to handle that route. The `SecureRoute` component does an extra check to ensure the user is logged in before allowing access to that route. If they are not then the `onAuthRequired` function in `index.js` will be called to force the user to the login page.

The only other really odd-looking thing here is the route for the login path. Instead of simply setting a component to handle the path, it runs a `render` method that renders the `LoginPage` component and sets the baseUrl from the configuration.

## Add API Endpoints to the Node App

You may remember that the Node API is doing the registration, so you'll need to add the endpoint to the Node app to handle that call. To do that, you'll need to add Okta's Node SDK. From the 'api' folder run:

```bash
npm install @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs --save
```

Then, you'll change the `users.js` file in `api/routes`. The file will look like:

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const oktaClient = require('../lib/oktaClient');

/* Create a new User (register). */
router.post('/', (req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.body) return res.sendStatus(400);
  const newUser = {
    profile: {
      firstName: req.body.firstName,
      lastName: req.body.lastName,
      email: req.body.email,
      login: req.body.email
    },
    credentials: {
      password: {
        value: req.body.password
      }
    }
  };
  oktaClient
    .createUser(newUser)
    .then(user => {
      res.status(201);
      res.send(user);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      res.status(400);
      res.send(err);
    });
});

module.exports = router;
```

The biggest things of note here are the importing of the `lib/oktaClient` (which you'll add in a moment), the call to the `createUser` function on `oktaClient`, and the shape of the `newUser` object. The shape of the `newUser` object is documented [in Okta's API documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/users).

For your Node application to make calls to your Okta application, it will need an API token. To create one, go into your Okta developer dashboard, hover over the API menu option and click on Tokens.

{% img blog/build-user-registration-with-node-react-and-okta/okta-api-tokens-screen.png alt:"okta api tokens screen" %}{: .center-image }

From there click Create Token. Give the token a name like "Membership" and click Create Token.

{% img blog/build-user-registration-with-node-react-and-okta/create-token-screen.png alt:"create token screen" %}{: .center-image }

Copy the token to a safe location for use later.

Create a file called `oktaClient.js` in a new folder called `lib` in the Node application. The file will configure a `Client` object from Okta's Node SDK using the API token you just created like this:

```js
const okta = require('@okta/okta-sdk-nodejs');

const client = new okta.Client({
  orgUrl: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}',
  token: '{yourApiToken}'
});

module.exports = client;
```

In the `app.js` file at the root of the Node app, update the file to have all calls route to `/api/<something>`. You'll see a section below the block of `app.use` statements. Change the route set up so that it looks like this:

```js
app.use('/api', indexRouter);
app.use('/api/users', usersRouter);
```

If your Node app is still running, you will need to stop the app (with CTRL+C) and rerun it (with `npm start`) for the updates to take effect.

Even though the site still needs some serious style love, you will now be able to register users, log in with the newly created user and get the logged in user's profile for display on the profile page!
