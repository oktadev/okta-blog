You've built a React app, but now you need to deploy it. What do you do? First, it's probably best to choose a cloud provider as they're typically low-cost and easy to deploy to.

Most cloud providers offer a way to deploy a static site. Heroku supports static sites, easily deploys apps with Git, and provides a CLI that developers love. A built React app is just JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. They're static files that can live on pretty much any web server. In fact, with JSX (HTML in JS) and Styled Components, you could even say _it's just JavaScript_!

Docker is the de facto standard to build and share containerized applications. You can use it to package your apps and include many open source web servers to serve up your app. As an added bonus, you can configure the webserver to send security headers that make your app more secure.

## Create a React App

Rather than showing you how to build a React app, I'm going to cheat and use one that a colleague of mine already built. To begin, clone the repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-styled-components-example.git react-docker
cd react-docker
npm install
```

This is a React app that uses Styled Components for its CSS and is secured by OpenID Connect (aka OIDC). You can read about how it was created in [Build a React App with Styled Components](/blog/2020/03/16/react-styled-components).

{% include setup/cli.md type="spa" framework="React" 
   loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000/callback" %}

Copy and paste the issuer and client ID into your application's `src/App.js`.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Security issuer='<yourIssuerURI>'
                clientId='<yourClientId>'
                redirectUri={window.location.origin + '/callback'}
                pkce={true}>
        <SecureRoute path='/' exact={true} component={Calendar}/>
        <Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback}/>
      </Security>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

_The `<>` brackets are just placeholders, so make sure to remove them!_

Start your app with `npm start`. You'll be redirected to Okta to authenticate, then back to your app. If you're not redirected, it's because you're already logged in. Try again in a private window to see the login process.

You'll see a simple, clean calendar, with today's date selected.

{% img blog/react-docker/calendar.png alt:"Calendar" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

I'll admit it's a very simple app, but it'll do for demonstrating how to containerize with Docker.

## Why Docker?

You might ask, "Why Docker? Doesn't that complicate things"?

Yes, I agree. Doing it with Docker is more complicated than doing a `git push` with Heroku. However, it also gives you more control in case you _really_ want to complicate things and manage your app with Kubernetes. ðŸ˜›

## Create a Dockerfile and Nginx Configuration

Create a `Dockerfile` in your root directory.

```dockerfile
FROM node:14.1-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /opt/web
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

ENV PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"

COPY . ./
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:1.17-alpine
RUN apk --no-cache add curl
RUN curl -L https://github.com/a8m/envsubst/releases/download/v1.1.0/envsubst-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o envsubst && \
    chmod +x envsubst && \
    mv envsubst /usr/local/bin
COPY ./nginx.config /etc/nginx/nginx.template
CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "envsubst < /etc/nginx/nginx.template > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && nginx -g 'daemon off;'"]
COPY --from=builder /opt/web/build /usr/share/nginx/html
```

This will build your project and add Nginx as a web server. It'll also install a version of `envsubst` that allows you to replace variables with environment variables, and set default values.

Create an `nginx.config` in the same directory:

```config
server {
    listen       ${PORT:-80};
    server_name  _;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $$uri /index.html;
    }
}
```

This file configures Nginx to serve your React app as a SPA (where all routes go to `index.html`) and run on port 80 unless `PORT` is defined as an environment variable. There's two `$$` in front of `uri` to prevent `$uri` from getting replaced with a blank value.

## Build a Docker Image with Your React App

Make sure your Docker daemon is running with `docker ps`. Then, run the following command to build your Docker image. The `react-docker` value can be whatever you want to name your image.

```shell
docker build -t react-docker .
```

When the process completes, you'll see something along the lines of the following message:

```shell
Successfully built 3211a1255527
Successfully tagged react-docker:latest
```

## Run Your Docker + React App

You can now run your React app via Docker on port 3000 using the `docker run` command.

```shell
docker run -p 3000:80 react-docker
```

> If you find these `docker` commands hard to remember, you can add a couple of scripts to your `package.json` file.
> 
> ```json
> "docker": "docker build -t react-docker .",
> "react-docker": "docker run -p 3000:80 react-docker"
> ```
> 
> Then you can run them with `npm run docker` and `npm run react-docker`.

You'll likely be logged in automatically.

**TIP:** If you want to see an example that doesn't log you in right away, see our [Okta React + Okta Hosted Login Example](https://github.com/okta/samples-js-react/tree/master/okta-hosted-login).

Pretty slick, eh?! You dockerized your React app in just a few minutes. ðŸŽ‰

## Deploy Your React App to Heroku

Your app doesn't really exist until it's in production, so let's deploy it to Heroku. First, I'll show you can do it without Docker.

To begin, you'll need [a Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/login). Then, install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

Open a terminal, log in to your Heroku account, and create a new app.

```shell
heroku login
heroku create
```

You should now have a new `heroku` Git remote repository. You can confirm this with `git remote -v`.

Create a `static.json` file in your root directory with security headers and redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "/**": {
      "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self' https://*.okta.com;",
      "Referrer-Policy": "no-referrer, strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
      "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains",
      "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
      "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
      "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
      "Feature-Policy": "accelerometer 'none'; camera 'none'; microphone 'none'"
    }
  },
  "https_only": true,
  "root": "build/",
  "routes": {
    "/**": "index.html"
  }
}
```

For `static.json` to be read, you have to use the [Heroku static buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static).

Commit your changes to Git, add the Node.js + static buildpacks, and deploy your React app.

```shell
git commit -am "Configure secure headers and static buildpacks"
heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static.git
git push heroku master
```

Once the process completes, open your app in a browser using:

```shell
heroku open
```

You'll be redirected to Okta and likely see the following error:

```
The 'redirect_uri' parameter must be an absolute URI that is whitelisted in the client app settings.
```

To fix this, you'll need to modify your Okta app to add your Heroku URL as a **Login redirect URI**. For example, `https://gentle-peak-37809.herokuapp.com/callback`. Run `okta login` and open the resulting URL in your browser. Sign in to the Okta Admin Console and edit your app's general settings in the **Applications** section. 

You should now be able to log in and see your app running on Heroku! You can verify its security headers are A-OK on <https://securityheaders.com>.

{% img blog/react-docker/headers-buildpack.png alt:"Security headers with Node.js and static buildpacks" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

In this deployment example, buildpacks do all the work for you. However, not every cloud provider has buildpacks. This is where Docker comes in.

## Deploy Your Docker + React App to Heroku

Heroku has a couple of slick features when it comes to Docker images. If your project has a `Dockerfile`, you can deploy your app directly using the [Heroku Container Registry](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime).

First, log in to the Container Registry.

```shell
heroku container:login
```

Then, create a new app.

```
heroku create
```

Add the Git URL as a new remote to your app.

```shell
git remote add docker https://git.heroku.com/<your-app-name>.git
```

Then, push your Docker image to Heroku's Container Registry.

```shell
heroku container:push web --remote docker
```

Once the process has completed, release the image of your app:

```shell
heroku container:release web --remote docker
```

And, open the app in your browser:

```
heroku open --remote docker
```

You'll need to add your app's URI in Okta before you can log in.

### Improve Security Headers for Nginx in Docker

If you test your new Nginx in Docker site on [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/), you'll get an **F**.

To solve this, modify your `nginx.config` to add security headers.

```config
server {
    listen       ${PORT:-80};
    server_name  _;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $$uri /index.html;
    }

    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self' https://*.okta.com;";
    add_header Referrer-Policy "no-referrer, strict-origin-when-cross-origin";
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header Feature-Policy "accelerometer 'none'; camera 'none'; microphone 'none'";
}
```

After updating this file, run the following commands:

```shell
heroku container:push web --remote docker
heroku container:release web --remote docker
```

Now you should get an **A**!

## Use Cloud Native Buildpacks to Create Your React + Docker Image

In this post, you learned two ways to deploy your React app to Heroku. The first was to utilize buildpacks and `git push`. The second was to use Heroku's Container Registry and `heroku container:push` + `heroku push:release`.

[Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) is an initiative that was started by Pivotal and Heroku in early 2018. It has a [`pack` CLI](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack) that allows you to build Docker images using buildpacks.

{% img blog/react-docker/joe-kutner.jpg alt:"Joe Kutner" %}{: .BlogPost-avatar .pull-right .img-150px }

My good friend, [Joe Kutner](https://twitter.com/codefinger), is a Software Architect at Heroku and has been instrumental in making Cloud Native Buildpacks a reality. Joe was formerly the curator of the Java experience at Heroku, is an active committer on the JHipster project, authored [The Healthy Programmer](http://healthyprog.com/), and is a founding member of the Cloud Native Buildpacks core team. His advice when it comes to Docker is "don't use a `Dockerfile` if you don't have to". 

Joe was a big help in figuring out how to create a Docker image with buildpacks, so I credit him with the instructions below.

To begin, [install `pack`](https://buildpacks.io/docs/install-pack/). If you're on a Mac or Linux, you can use Homebrew.

```shell
brew tap buildpack/tap
brew install pack
```

_If you're on Windows, you can [install its executable](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/releases/download/v0.10.0/pack-v0.10.0-windows.zip)._

In the previous buildpacks example, I used Heroku's Node.js and static buildpacks.

The Heroku static buildpack isn't a "Cloud Native" buildpack. It uses the old (pre-cloud-native) API. That means it doesn't work with `pack` out of the box.

Luckily, Heroku does offer a [cnb-shim](https://github.com/heroku/cnb-shim) you can use to make it work. Joe created a URL--https://cnb-shim.herokuapp.com/v1/heroku-community/static-- for Heroku's static buildpack after converting it with `cnb-shim`. 

You do have to make one change before you can build and run the Docker image locally. **Remove the `"https_only": true,"` line from `static.json`**.

Then, use the following command to build a Docker image with Node.js and the static buildpack (a.k.a., the same buildpacks you used on Heroku).

```shell
pack build react-pack --builder heroku/buildpacks \
  --buildpack heroku/nodejs,https://cnb-shim.herokuapp.com/v1/heroku-community/static
```

**TIP**: You can use `pack set-default-builder heroku/buildpacks` if you want to get rid of the `--builder` argument.

Once the process completes, you should be able to run it.

```shell
docker run --rm -it --init -p 3000:3000 --env PORT=3000 okta
```

If you find these `pack` commands hard to remember, you can add them to your `package.json`.

```json
"pack": "pack build react-pack --builder heroku/buildpacks --buildpack heroku/nodejs,https://cnb-shim.herokuapp.com/v1/heroku-community/static",
"react-pack": "docker run --rm -it --init -p 3000:3000 --env PORT=3000 react-pack"
```

Then you can run them with `npm run pack` and `npm run react-pack`. 

## Deploy Your React + Docker Image to Docker Hub

You can easily share your Docker containers by deploying them to a registry, like Docker Hub. If you don't already have a Docker Hub account, you can [create one](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

Once you have an account, log in and push your image. In the example below, I'm using `react-docker`, but you could also use `react-pack` to deploy the buildpacks version.

```shell
docker login
docker image tag react-docker <your-username>/react-docker
docker push <your-username>/react-docker
```

This will tag it as `latest` by default. If you want to tag and push a particular version, you can use:

```shell
docker image tag react-docker <your-username>/react-docker:1.0
docker push <your-username>/react-docker
```

Then, someone else could pull and run it using:

```shell
docker run -p 3000:80 <your-username>/react-docker
```

## Deploy Your React + Docker Image to Heroku

To deploy an existing image to Heroku you can use `docker push`. You have to use the following naming convention to tag and push the image.

```shell
docker tag <image> registry.heroku.com/<app>/<process-type>
docker push registry.heroku.com/<app>/<process-type>
```

For example, to deploy the `react-pack` image, you can do:

```shell
docker tag react-pack registry.heroku.com/fierce-eyrie-08414/web
docker push registry.heroku.com/fierce-eyrie-08414/web
heroku container:release web --remote docker
```

I tried this and noticed that HTTPS wasn't forced. I had to add `"https_only": true` back into `static.json`, then re-push.

## Learn More About Heroku, Docker, and React

In this tutorial, you learned how to use Docker to containerize your React application. You can do this manually with `docker build` or use Heroku's Container Registry to push and release projects with a `Dockerfile`. You can also use the `pack` command to leverage Cloud-Native + Heroku buildpacks when building a container.

You also learned that if you're using Heroku, its buildpacks make it even easier than Docker. With a simple `git push`, you can deploy your code and have it built on Heroku's servers. 

You can find the source code for this example on GitHub at [oktadeveloper/okta-react-docker-example](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-docker-example).
