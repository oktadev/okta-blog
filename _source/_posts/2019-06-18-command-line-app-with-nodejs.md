Command line applications (CLI) are often the core tools for automating tasks, such as deploying production applications, running tests, building reports, migrating data, DevOps, and the list goes on and on. If you find yourself doing the same things over and over again, chances are you can automate those steps with a script and save yourself a lot of time!

Node.js is a great solution for writing CLI apps. Node.js itself has built-in libraries for reading and writing files, launching other applications, and basic network communication. Beyond that, there are thousands of packages available on `npm` for just about any kind of task imaginable.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Command Line Application with Node.js that can be used on Windows, macOS, or Linux. You will also learn how to style the output of a Node.js CLI application, accept arguments (parameters), and how to authenticate an API from the command line using OAuth 2.0 and PKCE.

## Build Your First Node.js Command Line Application

First, let's make sure you have the tools required. To complete this tutorial, you will need the following:

* A recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) downloaded and installed
* A good text editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* A [free Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)

Next, open your computer's command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux). Change the current directory to the folder where you save your documents or projects. Enter the following commands to create a new project folder and initialize the project.

```sh
mkdir hello-cli
cd hello-cli
npm init
```

Next, open the `hello-cli` folder in your favorite text editor. create a folder named `bin` and add a new file to the `bin` folder named `index.js`. Open the `index.js` file in your text editor and copy the following code.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log( "Hello!" );
```

The first line that begins with `#!` is usually called a "shebang." This is normally only used on Linux or UNIX operating systems to inform the system what type of script is included in the rest of the text file. However, this first line is also required for Node.js scripts to be installed and run properly on macOS and Windows.

Next, open the `package.json` file in the root of the project in your text editor. Change the `main` value to `bin/index.js`. Add a new key for `bin` with the following text.

```json
 "bin": {
   "hello": "./bin/index.js"
 }
```

> Note: Don't forget to add a comma after the previous value. All key/value pairs are separated by commas. The most common mistake when editing a JSON file is leaving out a comma.

Your entire `package.json` file should look similar to the following.

```json
{
 "name": "hello-cli",
 "version": "1.0.0",
 "description": "",
 "main": "bin/index.js",
 "scripts": {
   "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
 },
 "keywords": [],
 "author": "David Neal (https://reverentgeek.com)",
 "license": "MIT",
 "bin": {
   "hello": "./bin/index.js"
 }
}
```

At this point, you can run the script just like any other Node.js application. Try entering the following from the command line.

```bash
node .
```

However, the goal of writing a script like this is to be able to run it from anywhere. You can do that with the `npm install` command.

```bash
npm install -g .
```

This installs your script "globally." Any commands listed in the `bin` section of the `package.json` file will be made available as command line applications. You can now run your script by typing `hello` at the command line!

```bash
hello
```

To uninstall your script, run the following command.

```bash
npm uninstall -g hello-cli
```

> Tip: You can list all globally installed Node.js modules using `npm ls -g --depth=0`.

## Make Text Stand Out with Color and Borders

Writing plain text directly to the console will get the job done, but sometimes it is nice (or even necessary) to have content stand out. For example, you may want to display error messages using the color red.

To modify the color of text and background color, you can use `chalk`. To add borders around your text to make it more visible, you can use a module named `boxen`. Add both of these to your project.

```bash
npm install chalk@2.4 boxen@4.0
```

Next, replace the contents of `bin/index.js` with the following code.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const chalk = require("chalk");
const boxen = require("boxen");

const greeting = chalk.white.bold("Hello!");

const boxenOptions = {
 padding: 1,
 margin: 1,
 borderStyle: "round",
 borderColor: "green",
 backgroundColor: "#555555"
};
const msgBox = boxen( greeting, boxenOptions );

console.log(msgBox);
```

Next, install the updated script and run it.

```bash
npm install -g .
hello
```

The message in your console should look similar to this image.

## Add Support for Command Line Arguments

Most CLI applications accept one or more command line arguments, such as optional/required parameters, commands, flags/switches, or other configuration values. Although you can parse command line parameters by inspecting the Node.js `process.argv` value, there are modules available that will save you a lot of time and effort. The `yargs` module is one such module for Node.js designed to support the most common CLI scenarios.

First, install the `yargs` module as a dependency for your application.

```bash
npm install yargs@13.2
```

Next, update the `bin/index.js` file with the following code.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const yargs = require("yargs");

const options = yargs
 .usage("Usage: -n <name>")
 .option("n", { alias: "name", describe: "Your name", type: "string", demandOption: true })
 .argv;

const greeting = `Hello, ${options.name}!`;

console.log(greeting);
```

The previous code imports the `yargs` module and configures it to require one argument for `name`. Next, install the updated script globally.

```bash
npm install -g .
```

The `name` parameter is required (`demandOption: true`), so if you try to run the `hello` script the same as before, you should see something like the following:

```bash
> hello

Usage: -n <name>

Options:
 --help      Show help                                                [boolean]
 --version   Show version number                                      [boolean]
 -n, --name  Your name                                      [string] [required]

Missing required argument: n
```

The `yargs` module automatically builds a great response for displaying help! Your CLI is not only ready to accept `-n` and `--name` arguments but also `--help` and `--version`. Try running your CLI application with any of the arguments.

```bash
> hello -n me

Hello, me!

> hello --version

0.1.0
```

> Note: The value displayed for `--version` comes from the version number in the `package.json` file.

## Call Your Node.js API from the Command Line

A common scenario in automating tasks is to call an API endpoint to get data or to send data to an API endpoint. In this part of the tutorial, you are going to fetch a random joke from a joke API and display it in the console.

One of the most popular libraries for retrieving and sending data to an API in Node.js is `axios`. Start by adding `axios` as a dependency.

```bash
npm install axios@0.21.1
```

Next, replace the contents of `bin/index.js` with the following code.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const yargs = require("yargs");
const axios = require("axios");

const options = yargs
 .usage("Usage: -n <name>")
 .option("n", { alias: "name", describe: "Your name", type: "string", demandOption: true })
 .argv;

const greeting = `Hello, ${options.name}!`;
console.log(greeting);

console.log("Here's a random joke for you:");

const url = "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/";

axios.get(url, { headers: { Accept: "application/json" } })
 .then(res => {
   console.log(res.data.joke);
 });
```

In addition to responding with a greeting, the CLI application will now retrieve a random joke using `axios` and display it immediately after the greeting.

### Add a Search Argument to Your Node.js Command Line Application

You can take the CLI application one step further by supporting a search argument. Replace the contents of `bin/index.js` with the following code.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const yargs = require("yargs");
const axios = require("axios");

const options = yargs
 .usage("Usage: -n <name>")
 .option("n", { alias: "name", describe: "Your name", type: "string", demandOption: true })
 .option("s", { alias: "search", describe: "Search term", type: "string" })
 .argv;

const greeting = `Hello, ${options.name}!`;
console.log(greeting);

if (options.search) {
 console.log(`Searching for jokes about ${options.search}...`)
} else {
 console.log("Here's a random joke for you:");
}

// The url depends on searching or not
const url = options.search ? `https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=${escape(options.search)}` : "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/";

axios.get(url, { headers: { Accept: "application/json" } })
 .then(res => {
   if (options.search) {
     // if searching for jokes, loop over the results
     res.data.results.forEach( j => {
       console.log("\n" + j.joke);
     });
     if (res.data.results.length === 0) {
       console.log("no jokes found :'(");
     }
   } else {
     console.log(res.data.joke);
   }
 });
```

In the previous code, you added support for a new `--search` argument. Depending on retrieving a random joke or searching for specific jokes, the code uses a different URL and must handle the results differently.

Try it out!

```bash
> npm install -g .
> hello -n me -s orange
```

## Add Support for Secure Authorization with PKCE

An API that requires basic authentication is fairly straight-forward. But, what if an API uses OAuth for authentication? Yes, it is possible to support APIs that use the latest OAuth open standards from the command line, too!

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is a better solution for mobile and native applications to exchange private keys with an authorization server. For this step in the tutorial, you are going to use the Okta API. However, it should be possible to adapt the code to work with any OAuth 2.0 service you're using. Okta is a free-to-use API service for user accounts and simplifies handling user authentication, authorization, social login, password reset, and so forth. Okta utilizes open standards like OAuth 2.0 to make integration seamless.

### Create an Okta Application

{% include setup/cli.md type="native" loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080/callback" logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:8080" %}

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your Node.js CLI project. Open this file and add the following information.

```bash
OKTA_ORG_URL=https://{yourOktaOrgUrl}
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientID}
OKTA_SCOPES="openid profile email"
OKTA_REDIRECT_PORT=8080
```

### Update the Node.js Command Line Application

To support the PKCE authentication flow, your CLI application needs a few more libraries. In this tutorial, you will use `hapi` to create a web server to handle the authentication callback. `dotenv` is used to read configuration settings from the `.env` file. You will use `open` to launch the default browser for login. And, `uuid` is used to help generate a unique private key to exchange with the authentication server.

```bash
npm install @hapi/hapi@18.3 dotenv@8.0 open@6.3 uuid@3.3
```

Now, create a new folder in the root of the project named `src`. In this folder, create a new file named `authClient.js`. Add the following code to the `src/authClient.js` file.

```javascript
"use strict";

const axios = require( "axios" );
const crypto = require( "crypto" );
const hapi = require( "@hapi/hapi" );
const open = require( "open" );
const querystring = require( "querystring" );
const uuid = require( "uuid/v1" );

const base64url = str => {
 return str.replace( /\+/g, "-" ).replace( /\//g, "_" ).replace( /=+$/, "" );
};
 module.exports = ( { oktaOrgUrl, clientId, scopes, serverPort } ) => {
 if ( !oktaOrgUrl || !clientId || !scopes || !serverPort ) {
   throw new Error( "Okta organization URL, client ID, scopes, and server port are required." );
 }
 // code verifier must be a random string with a minimum of 43 characters
 const codeVerifier = uuid() + uuid();
 const redirectUri = `http://localhost:${serverPort}/callback`;

 const buildAuthorizeUrl = ( codeChallenge ) => {
   const data = {
     client_id: clientId,
     response_type: "code",
     scope: scopes,
     redirect_uri: redirectUri,
     state: uuid(),
     code_challenge_method: "S256",
     code_challenge: codeChallenge
   };
   const params = querystring.stringify( data );
   const authorizeUrl = `${oktaOrgUrl}/oauth2/v1/authorize?${params}`;
   return authorizeUrl;
 };

 const getUserInfo = async accessToken => {
   try {
     const config = {
       headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` }
     };
     const url = `${oktaOrgUrl}/oauth2/v1/userinfo`;
     const res = await axios.get( url, config );
     return res.data;
   } catch ( err ) {
     console.log( "error getting user info", err ); // eslint-disable-line no-console
     throw err;
   }
 };

 const getToken = async code => {
   try {
     const request = {
       grant_type: "authorization_code",
       redirect_uri: redirectUri,
       client_id: clientId,
       code,
       code_verifier: codeVerifier
     };
     const url = `${oktaOrgUrl}/oauth2/v1/token`;
     const data = querystring.stringify( request );
     const res = await axios.post( url, data );
     return res.data;
   } catch ( err ) {
     console.log( "error getting token", err ); // eslint-disable-line no-console
     throw err;
   }
 };
  // Start server and begin auth flow
 const executeAuthFlow = () => {
   return new Promise( async ( resolve, reject ) => {
     const server = hapi.server( {
       port: serverPort,
       host: "localhost"
     } );

     server.route( {
       method: "GET",
       path: "/callback",
       handler: async request => {
         try {
           const code = request.query.code;
           const token = await getToken( code );
           const userInfo = await getUserInfo( token.access_token );
           resolve( { token, userInfo } );
           return `Thank you, ${userInfo.given_name}. You can close this tab.`;
         } catch ( err ) {
           reject( err );
         } finally {
           server.stop();
         }
       }
     } );
     await server.start();

     const codeChallenge = base64url( crypto.createHash( "sha256" ).update( codeVerifier ).digest( "base64" ) );
     const authorizeUrl = buildAuthorizeUrl( codeChallenge );
     open( authorizeUrl );
   } );
 };
  return {
   executeAuthFlow
 };
};
```

There's a lot going on in this module, so here's a breakdown of how to use the module and what it is doing.

The `authClient.js` module exports one function that accepts an object with the properties `oktaOrgUrl`, `clientId`, `scopes`, and `serverPort`. Calling this function will initialize the module with the configuration it needs. After initializing, the function returns an object with exactly one function, `executeAuthFlow`.

Calling `executeAuthFlow` goes through the following steps:

1. A new web server is created using `hapi` with one `/callback` route (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/callback`).
1. The `codeVerifier` private key is generated and hashed to create the `codeChallenge`.
1. The function opens the default browser and navigates to the authorization server.
1. If not already logged in, the user must log in to the authentication server.
1. Once authenticated, the browser is redirected to the `/callback` URL with a code.
1. The callback handler uses the code and the `codeVerifier` value to request an authentication token.
1. The authorization server verifies the `code`, hashes the `codeVerifier` and compares it to the `codeChallenge` value it stored earlier and replies with an authentication token.
1. The function uses the returned token to call another API endpoint to retrieve account information.
1. The token and account information are returned to the caller that invoked `executeAuthFlow`.

{% img blog/command-line-apps-with-nodejs/cli-pkce-auth-flow.png alt:"CLI PKCE auth flow" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

> Note: Retrieving account information is not part of the PKCE authentication flow. This step is only included as an example of how to use the token once it is acquired!

Next is to update the CLI to use the `authClient.js` module. Create a new file under `bin` named `pkceLogin.js`. Add the following code to the `pkceLogin.js` file.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
"use strict";

const chalk = require( "chalk" );
const dotenv = require( "dotenv" );
const authClient = require( "../src/authClient" );

// read in settings
dotenv.config();

const config = {
 oktaOrgUrl: process.env.OKTA_ORG_URL,
 clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
 scopes: process.env.OKTA_SCOPES,
 serverPort: process.env.OKTA_REDIRECT_PORT
};

const main = async () => {
 try {
   const auth = authClient( config );
   const { token, userInfo } = await auth.executeAuthFlow();
   console.log( token, userInfo );
   console.log( chalk.bold( "You have successfully authenticated your CLI application!" ) );
 } catch ( err ) {
   console.log( chalk.red( err ) );
 }
};

main();
```

Update the `package.json` file to include another command in the `bin` section.

```json
 "bin": {
   "hello": "./bin/index.js",
   "pkce-login": "./bin/pkceLogin.js"
 },
```

Update the CLI applications that are installed globally.

```bash
npm install -g .
```

Now, you are ready to test your new CLI authentication! After logging in, you should see in your console, `You have successfully authenticated your CLI application!`

```bash
pkce-login
```
