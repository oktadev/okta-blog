# Developer Day 2021: A Free Virtual Event to Celebrate the Future of Identity 


It’s been a big year for Okta and Auth0. Our two companies have officially joined forces over the past few months, and we are excited about the chance to shape the future of identity together. It’s great to celebrate our combined developer communities at the first Developer Day event. 

I look forward to exploring more ways to bring our communities together in the future in collaboration with our Auth0 counterparts. 

On Tuesday, 8/24, Developer Day will bring our communities together under the powerful idea of “Auth for All,” featuring speakers from Okta, Auth0, and the broader developer ecosystem. We’ll dive into app security, OAuth, infrastructure, and more. We are also hosting a day of free, hands-on virtual labs on August 25th, giving developers a chance to learn by doing. 

## Spotlight on Speakers

I’m particularly excited about the diversity of our community, which we’ll showcase tomorrow at Developer Day. Our developer communities are global and include a wide variety of people, skills, and perspectives. Close to my own heart, as a woman leader in tech, I’m thrilled to highlight the extraordinary women who’ve agreed to share their expertise at Developer Day. They include:

[Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co/): The director of Developer Experience at Netlify, Cassidy is an avid speaker and developer advocate. She’s been featured in Glamour Magazine's *35 Women Under 35 Changing the Tech Industry* and appears in *Big Dream*, a documentary about women who are breaking down barriers to follow their passion in science, math, computing, and engineering. 

[Alyssa Miller](https://alyssasec.com/): As a hacker, researcher, and security advocate, Alyssa is committed to educating and inspiring others in the software development space. She’s spent her career speaking on technical and policy issues alike, advocating for privacy protection, and building trust with secure systems.

[Milecia McGregor](https://www.mediavine.com/team/milecia-mcgregor/): Milecia is a senior software engineer, international tech speaker, and scientist who works with both hardware and software. She’s published her research on machine learning and robotics and started *Flipped Coding* in 2017 to help people learn web development with real-world projects.

[Heather Downing](https://developer.okta.com/blog/authors/heather-downing/): Principal Developer Advocate at Okta, Heather is a passionate coder and international tech industry speaker from Kansas City, Missouri.  She’s been recognized as a Microsoft MVP and .NET Foundation member. Heather, a fierce advocate for women in tech, encourages those with non-traditional backgrounds to enter the world of software development and has built her reputation as an early adopter of new tech - without a degree.

[Jessica Temporal](https://jtemporal.com/): Jessica is a senior developer advocate at Auth0 and is the co-founder and co-host of Pizza de Dados, the first (and most beloved) Brazilian podcast about data science. She’s an active participant in PyLadies, an international network for promoting and empowering women in technology focused on the Python open-source community.

[ Kapehe](https://www.sanity.io/exchange/community/kapehe): Kapehe is a talented Sanity.io developer who finds joy in helping devs create, whether it’s a quick JAMstack project or a reliable content backend.
