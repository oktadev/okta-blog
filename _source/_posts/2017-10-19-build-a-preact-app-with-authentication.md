React is a fast, and lightweight library, which has led to fast adoption across
the SPA (single-page app) ecosystem. Preact is an even lighter-and-faster
alternative to React, weighing in at a measly 3kb! For less complex
applications, it can be a great choice.

In this tutorial, you'll build a basic Preact application with a couple of pages
and user authentication using the [Okta Sign-In
Widget](https://developer.okta.com/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget).


## Bootstrap Your App With PreactCLI

To get your project started, you'll install the
[PreactCLI](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli) using
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preact-cli).

```bash
npm install -g preact-cli
```

Once you have the CLI installed, run the command to create a base Preact
application with the default template:

```bash
preact create default okta-preact-example
```

This command will chug along for a few minutes scaffolding a basic Preact app
and installing all the dependencies. Once it's done, you should see a bunch of
information on the command line informing you of what you can do next.

Change into the application directory.

```bash
cd okta-preact-example
```

Then start the application, just to make sure everything worked as expected.

```bash
npm start
```

You should see a quick build run and the screen will clear and show you that the
application is running at `http://localhost:8080`. When you open up that URL in
your browser, you should see a page like this:

### Some Things To Note About PreactCLI

Even though the PreactCLI-generated app looks a lot like a React app generated
by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app),
and you can even use some of the React plugins (like
[React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)) in your Preact
application, there are some significant differences.

For instance, unlike the ReactCLI, there is no way to `eject` the
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configuration. Instead Preact encourages
developers to customize Webpack by creating a file called `preact.config.js`,
using Preact's [Webpack Config
Helpers](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/HEAD/docs/webpack-helpers.md)
and exporting functions to change the way Webpack behaves.

Even though the PreactCLI says the application is running at
`http://0.0.0.0:8080`, use `http://localhost:8080`. It's the same thing and when
you set up your application in the Okta dashboard, you'll set
`http://localhost:8080` as your base URL and callback URL, so this just makes
sure that you can call the Okta APIs.


## Create Your Okta Application

Now that you have the basic shell of an application, it's time to add user
authentication. If you don't already have one, create a free (forever) account
at [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

Once you've created an account, go to the admin dashboard and click on
"Applications" in the page menu. Then click the green "Add Application" button,
then the green "Create New App" button, so that you see a modal window like:

{% img blog/build-a-preact-app-with-authentication/create-application-screen.png alt:"Create Application Screen" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

Choose "SPA" from the Platform buttons. Click the
"Next" button to create your application.

This will take you to a screen to "Application Settings" page of the Create
Application wizard. Enter "OktaPreactExample" in the Application name field and
add `http://localhost:8080` as your base URI and as a login redirect URI. When
you're done, your form should look like this:

{% img blog/build-a-preact-app-with-authentication/create-integration-screen.png alt:"Create Integration Screen" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

_You'll need to create a user (if you don't already have one) and assign your
new application to them as well. Or you can log in with the credentials you use
to log in to your Okta account (the admin user)._


## Install the Okta Sign In Widget

The easiest way to get Okta's authentication into your new Preact application
will be to use Okta's [Sign-In
Widget](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget). You'll install it with npm
using:

```bash
npm install @okta/okta-signin-widget --save
```


## Add an Auth Higher-Order Component

With that done, you now need to add some [Higher-Order
Components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html)
to help with authentication.

Add a file called `auth.js` in the `/src/lib` folder and add the following code:

```js
import {h} from 'preact';
import { route } from 'preact-router';
import OktaSignIn from '@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/js/okta-sign-in.min.js';
import '@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/css/okta-sign-in.min.css';
import '@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/css/okta-theme.css';

class Auth {
  constructor() {
    this.login = this.login.bind(this);
    this.logout = this.logout.bind(this);
    this.isAuthenticated = this.isAuthenticated.bind(this);
    this.handleAuthentication = this.handleAuthentication.bind(this);

    this.widget = new OktaSignIn({
      baseUrl: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/',
      clientId: '{clientId}',
      redirectUri: 'http://localhost:8080',
      authParams: {
        responseType: ['id_token', 'token'],
        scopes: ['openid', 'email', 'profile']
      }
    });
  }

  isAuthenticated() {
    // Checks if there is a current accessToken in the TokenManger.
    return !!this.widget.tokenManager.get('accessToken');
  }

  getCurrentUser(){
    return this.widget.tokenManager.get('idToken');
  }

  login() {
    // Redirect to the login page
    route('/login/');
  }

  async logout() {
    this.widget.tokenManager.clear();
    await this.widget.signOut();
    location = '/';
  }

  handleAuthentication(tokens) {
    for (let token of tokens) {
      if (token.idToken) {
        this.widget.tokenManager.add('idToken', token);
      } else if (token.accessToken) {
        this.widget.tokenManager.add('accessToken', token);
      }
    }
  }
}

// create a singleton
const auth = new Auth();
export const withAuth = WrappedComponent => props =>
  <WrappedComponent auth={auth} {...props} />;
```

In the first line of code, you can tell something's different. The `h` module in
Preact is what turns
[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html) into [DOM
elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).
Normally, React would use the `React` library to generate `React.createElement`
statements to make DOM elements from JSX. Preact uses the `h` library to make
something like `h('div', {class:'something'}, 'Content')` statements to do that.

Next, you imported `route` from preact-router right below the `h` import. This
is what is used by Preact to do the redirects in the `login` function. Notice
that the `Auth` class is just a regular function and does not extend
`Component`. In the constructor, the internal functions were bound with the
`this` context from the Auth class.

Then enter your Okta organization URL and client ID to the Okta Sign-In Widget
configuration. Your Organization URL will be the URL you use when you log into
your Okta account (e.g. `http://{yourOktaDomain}`) and you can get your
client ID from the application's property page in the administrative dashboard
on the "General" tab for your application (obviously, yours won't be blurred
out):

{% img blog/build-a-preact-app-with-authentication/client-id-screen.png alt:"Client ID Screen" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

You'll also want to change the `redirectUri` property to `http://localhost:8080`
because the Preact uses port `8080` instead of `3000` for normal React apps.

The `login` function simply routes the user to the login page, while the
`logout` function clears the tokens saved in the widget's token manager, calls
`signOut` on the widget, and redirects the user to the root of the application.

Finally, a singleton of the `Auth` class is created to be shared by all the
components, and is passed in as a prop called `auth` to any component that you
wrap in `withAuth`.


## Create a Widget Wrapper

Create a file in your `/src/lib` folder called `OktaSignInWidget.js`. Enter the
code for this component:

```js
import { h, Component } from 'preact';

export default class OktaSignInWidget extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.widget = this.props.widget;
    this.widget.renderEl({ el: this.widgetContainer }, this.props.onSuccess, this.props.onError);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.widget.remove();
  }

  render() {
    return <div ref={(div) => { this.widgetContainer = div; }} />
  }
};
```

Here, the `componentDidMount` method renders the Okta Sign-In Widget to the
`div` in your render method and the `componentWillUnmount` function removes the
widget.

In the `render` method, there's some strange-looking code. This allows you to
set a reference to the current element into a variable called `widgetContainer`
and then use it in the `componentDidMount` as `this.widgetContainer`. Neat, huh?
Thanks to [Matt Raible](https://twitter.com/mraible) for showing me that trick!


## Create a Redirect Component

The React-Router has a Redirect component in it, but the Preact router doesn't,
so you'll need one. Luckily, it's easy to create your own. In your `/src/lib`
folder create a file called `Redirect.js` and add the following code:

```js
import { Component } from 'preact';

export default class Redirect extends Component {
  componentWillMount() {
    location = this.props.to.pathname;
  }

  render() {
    return null;
  }
}
```

This is just a component that will redirect based on a URL passed to it. In this
case, the use will be redirected using the `window.location` mechanism, mostly
because you'll want to refresh the page. You could also just use
`route(this.props.to.pathname)` and let Preact's router redirect the user.


## Create a Login Component

Next, create a `Login` folder in `src/routes`. In that folder create an
`index.js` file and a `style.css` file. This just follows along with the way the
Preact CLI creates components.

In the `index.js` file, create a `Login` component, wrapped in the `withAuth`
component. First, by importing the modules needed:

```js
import { h, Component } from 'preact';
import Redirect from '../../lib/Redirect';
import OktaSignInWidget from '../../lib/OktaSignInWidget';
import { withAuth } from '../../lib/auth';
```

Start the component by wrapping in the `withAuth` higher-order component you
created earlier, and set the beginning state. Here, you'll have the
`redirectToReferrer` set to false by default.

```js
export default withAuth(class Login extends Component {
  state = {
    redirectToReferrer: false
  };
}
```

In the `componentWillMount` lifecycle function, wire up the `onSuccess` and
`onError` functions and create them in your component.

```js
componentWillMount() {
  this.onSuccess = this.onSuccess.bind(this);
  this.onError = this.onError.bind(this);
}

onSuccess(tokens) {
  this.props.auth.handleAuthentication(tokens);
  this.setState({
    redirectToReferrer: true
  });
}

onError(err) {
  console.log('error logging in', err);
}
```

You'll notice your component passes handling of the authentication back to the
higher-order component. This is a prime example of the benefits of higher-order
components and composition in JavaScript.

Finally, create the `render` function that will make the decision about showing
the login widget or, if the user is already logged in, redirecting them to the
home page. You could also redirect the user to the page they were going to when
they were redirected to the login page, but let's skip that for now.

```js
render({location, auth}, {redirectToReferrer}) {
  let from;
  if (location && location.state) {
    from = location.state;
  } else {
    from = { pathname: '/' };
  }

  if (auth.isAuthenticated() || redirectToReferrer) {
    return <Redirect to={from} />;
  }

  return (
    <OktaSignInWidget
      widget={auth.widget}
      onSuccess={this.onSuccess}
      onError={this.onError} />
  );
}
```

You'll notice here that Preact is a little different in that it gives you
handles to `props` and `state` as parameters to the `render` function. This code
simply uses destructuring of those parameters to make using `location`, `auth`
and `redirectToReferrer` simple without having a ton of `this.props.{whatever}`.

So your final `/src/routes/login/index.js` file will look like:

```js
import { h, Component } from 'preact';
import Redirect from '../../lib/Redirect';
import OktaSignInWidget from '../../lib/OktaSignInWidget';
import { withAuth } from '../../lib/auth';

export default withAuth(class Login extends Component {
  state = {
    redirectToReferrer: false
  };

  componentWillMount() {
    this.onSuccess = this.onSuccess.bind(this);
    this.onError = this.onError.bind(this);
  }

  onSuccess(tokens) {
    this.props.auth.handleAuthentication(tokens);
    this.setState({
      redirectToReferrer: true
    });
  }

  onError(err) {
    console.log('error logging in', err);
  }

 render({location, auth}, {redirectToReferrer}) {
    let from;
    if (location && location.state) {
      from = location.state;
    } else {
      from = { pathname: '/' };
    }

    if (auth.isAuthenticated() || redirectToReferrer) {
      return <Redirect to={from} />;
    }

    return (
      <OktaSignInWidget
        widget={auth.widget}
        onSuccess={this.onSuccess}
        onError={this.onError} />
    );
  }
})
```


## Update the Profile Page

Now that you have the `Login` component and it is using the Okta Sign-In Widget,
use the `auth` component you created and update the profile page (in
`/src/routes/profile/index.js`) to give you some more information about the
user. This is what your final `/src/routes/profile/index.js` file should look
like:

```js
import { h, Component } from 'preact';
import { route } from 'preact-router';
import { withAuth } from '../../lib/auth';
import style from './style';

export default withAuth(class Profile extends Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
  }

  componentWillMount(){
    if(this.props.auth.isAuthenticated()){
      this.state = {
        user: this.props.auth.getCurrentUser()
      };
    }else{
      return route('/login/');
    }
  }

  render(props, { user }) {
    return (
      user ?
      <div class={style.profile}>
        <h3 class={style.heading}>Profile</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class={style.key}>Name:</span>
            <span class={style.value}>{user.claims.name}</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class={style.key}>Email:</span>
            <span class={style.value}>{user.claims.email}</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div> :
      null
    );
  }
})
```

You've added the authentication protection at the `Component` level in the
`componentWillMount` function of the component. If the user is authenticated, it
calls the `getCurrentUser` function on the higher-order component and adds the
user to the component's state. In the `render` function, you simply output the
user's name and email.


## Update the Header Component

Now you just need to get the routes into your application and get the menu to
link to them. Start by changing the `/src/components/header/index.js` file to:

```js
import { h, Component } from 'preact';
import { Link } from 'preact-router/match';
import { withAuth } from '../../lib/auth';
import style from './style';

export default withAuth(class Header extends Component {
  componentWillMount(){
    if(this.props.auth.isAuthenticated()){
      this.setState({
          user: this.props.auth.getCurrentUser()
      });
    }
  }

  render(props, {user}) {
    return (
      <header class={style.header}>
        <h1>Preact App</h1>
        <nav>
          <Link activeClassName={style.active} href="/">Home</Link>
          {user ? <Link activeClassName={style.active} href="/profile">Profile</Link> : null }
          {user
            ? <Link activeClassName={style.active} onClick={props.auth.logout.bind(null, props.history)} href="javascript:;">Logout</Link>
            : <Link activeClassName={style.active} onClick={props.auth.login.bind(null, props.history)} href="javascript:;">Login</Link>}
        </nav>
      </header>
    );
  }
})
```

This will show the "Login" button if the user is not logged in and the "Logout"
button if they are. It will also only show the "Profile" menu item to those
users who are logged in.


## Change Your Routing

Finally, change the routes in your `/src/components/app.js` file so that your
application knows about your new routes and how to handle them. So your new
`app.js` file will look like:

```js
import { h, Component } from 'preact';
import { Router } from 'preact-router';

import Header from './header';
import Home from '../routes/home';
import Profile from '../routes/profile';
import Login from '../routes/Login';
// import Home from 'async!./home';
// import Profile from 'async!./profile';

export default class App extends Component {
  /** Gets fired when the route changes.
   *  @param {Object} event   "change" event from [preact-router](http://git.io/preact-router)
   *  @param {string} event.url The newly routed URL
   */
  handleRoute = e => {
    this.currentUrl = e.url;
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div id="app">
        <Header />
        <Router onChange={this.handleRoute}>
          <Home path="/" />
          <Profile path="/profile/" />
          <Login path="/login/" />
        </Router>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

All that really changed is that you imported the newly created Login component
and remove the user property being passed into the Profile component and added a
new route for the Login component.


## Run Your New Preact Application!

You should now be able to save your work and run `npm start` in the root folder
and see a fully-functioning Preact application with user authentication via
Okta!

There are a lot of similarities between Preact and React, but there are some key
differences. Preact is meant for applications where keeping the size of the
download small is critical. There are some nice conveniences in the Preact
router, but there are some things missing (like `withRouter`). There are also
some neat conveniences, like having `props` and `state` passed to the `render`
function. All in all, I think Preact is neat, but I could see really needing a
full-fledged React for complex apps.
