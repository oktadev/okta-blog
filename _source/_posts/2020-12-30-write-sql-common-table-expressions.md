Common table expressions are a powerful feature of Microsoft SQL Server. They allow you to store a temporary result and execute a statement afterward using that result set. These can be helpful when trying to accomplish a complicated process that SQL Server isn't well suited to handle. CTEs allow you to perform difficult operations in two distinct steps that make the challenge easier to solve.

In this article, you will learn how to write common table expressions using Microsoft SQL Server. You will then learn how to use that statement in a .NET Core MVC web application that is secured using Okta. Okta is a powerful yet easy to use single sign-on provider. By making use of Okta's `Okta.AspNetCore` package from Nuget, you will learn how to secure your application and any data from your CTEs properly.

## Secure Your SQL CTE with an Okta Application

The first thing you want to do is set up your Okta application to handle your authentication. If you haven't done so yet, you can sign up for a free developer account [here](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

Log in to your Okta Developer console and click on **Add Application**. Select *Web* and click **Next**. On the next page, give your Okta application a meaningful name. You will also want to replace your URIs' ports from 8080 to 3000. Finally, set your *Logout redirect URIs* to `http://localhost:3000/signout/callback`.

Click on **Done**, and you will be taken to your application home screen. Make note of your *Client ID*, *Client secret*, and *Okta domain*, as you will need these in your web application.

## Prepare the SQL Database to Use with Your CTE

To work on your database, you will need to have a database first. Microsoft provides several samples via Github. For this project, I used the [Wide World Importers sample database v1.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0). To use this, you will need to have at least SQL 2016 installed. Microsoft provides `.bak` and `.bacpac` files for you to use.  

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Common table expressions are a temporary result set created by a simple query. Once this result set is obtained, you can perform SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, or MERGE operations on it. CTEs can be used in place of a complicated query - one with difficult joins and logic in it. By operating on a temporary result set, you can simplify the process, making it more readable, easier to optimize, and easier to debug. Let's take a look at how CTEs work, and how they can make your life easier.

The first thing you notice is that the tax rates are all wrong. You aren't supposed to charge tax unless the `DeliveryPostalCode` is `90490`. So, you'll need to update each line item in the `InvoiceLines` table. But, to get the `DeliveryPostalCode`, you need a join from the `InvoiceLines` table to the `Invoices` table; then, a join  to the `Customers` table. You can round up the `DeliveryPostalCode` and associate it to the `InvoiceID` with SELECT, using the common table expression below. Next, you can run one statement using the temporary results set `tax_update`. After creating your results set of `InvoiceID` and `DeliveryPostalCode`, you can update the `InvoiceLines` table with the new `TaxRate`, and then you can update the `TaxAmount` and `ExtendedPrice` with ease.  

```sql
--****************************
--BEGIN CTE
--****************************
WITH tax_update (InvoiceID, DeliveryPostalCode) AS (    SELECT 
        [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices].InvoiceID, 
        DeliveryPostalCode 
    FROM 
        [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices] 
        INNER JOIN [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] ON [Invoices].[InvoiceID] = [InvoiceLines].[InvoiceID] 
        INNER JOIN [Sales].[Customers] ON [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices].CustomerID = [Sales].[Customers].CustomerID
) 
UPDATE 
    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] 
SET 
    TaxRate = CASE WHEN DeliveryPostalCode = '90490' THEN 6.00 ELSE 0 END 
FROM 
    tax_update 
WHERE 
    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines].InvoiceID = tax_update.InvoiceId

--****************************
--END CTE
--****************************

UPDATE 
    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] 
SET 
    TaxAmount = TaxRate * Quantity * UnitPrice 
UPDATE 
    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] 
SET 
    ExtendedPrice = TaxAmount +(Quantity * UnitPrice)
```

Next, you can write a select using a CTE. The example below is a bit simple for a CTE (you can accomplish this just with a join) but it serves the purpose of showing you how a CTE is written for selects.

Here, you are selecting the `CustomerID` to use to obtain the `CustomerName` from the `Customers` table, along with the `StockItemId` to obtain the `StockItemName` in your application.  

```sql
WITH customer_items (CustomerID, StockItemId, Quantity, 
LineProfit) AS (    SELECT 
        CustomerID, 
        StockItemId, 
        SUM (Quantity) AS Quantity, 
        SUM (LineProfit) AS LineProfit 
    FROM 
        [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices] 
        INNER JOIN [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] ON [Invoices].[InvoiceID] = [InvoiceLines].[InvoiceID] 
    GROUP BY 
        CustomerID, 
        StockItemID
) 
SELECT 
    CustomerName, 
    customer_items.Quantity, 
    customer_items.LineProfit, 
    [Warehouse].[StockItems].[StockItemName] 
FROM 
    customer_items 
    INNER JOIN [Sales].[Customers] ON [Sales].[Customers].[CustomerId] = customer_items.CustomerID 
    INNER JOIN [Warehouse].[StockItems] ON customer_items.StockItemId = [Warehouse].[StockItems].[StockItemID]
```

## Create Your ASP.NET Core Web Application

Your SQL database is now set up, and it's time to begin working on your web application. Open Visual Studio 2019 and Create a new project. Select *ASP.NET Core Web Application* and press **Next**. Select *Web Application (Model-View-Controller)*. Ensure your framework is set to .NET Core 3.1 and uncheck *Configure for HTTPS*. Press **Create** and wait for your application scaffold.  

{% img blog/sql-cte/image2.png alt:"VS createnew project" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Once your application is created, open the project properties window and change your *App URL* to `http://localhost:3000` to match your Okta settings. Next, import the `Okta.AspNetCore` package from NuGet.

```cli
Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 3.5.0
```

Once that is completed, you can begin to add your code. First, take a look at your `appsettings.json` file. This is where you will add application-specific variables such as your Okta information or any connection strings. Replace the code in this file with the following. You will need to replace the `WideWorldImporters.ConnectionString` information with your connection string.

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "OktaDomain": "https://{yourOktaDomain}",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}"
  },
  "WideWorldImporters": {
    "ConnectionString": "{yourConnectionString}"
  }
}
```

Next, add a file to hold the SQL Settings for `WideWorldImporters`. Add a new folder called `Settings`, and add a class file called `SqlSettings.cs` to it. Add the following code:

```csharp
public class SqlSettings
{
    public string ConnectionString { get; set; }
}
```

This very simple class will be populated at start-up and injected into your controllers as needed. You can see that process by opening your `Startup.cs` file and replacing the code with the following:

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddAuthentication(options =>
        {
            options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
            options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        })
       .AddCookie()
       .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
       {
           OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue<string>("Okta:OktaDomain"),
           ClientId = Configuration.GetValue<string>("Okta:ClientId"),
           ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue<string>("Okta:ClientSecret"),
           Scope = new List<string> { "openid", "profile", "email" },
       });

        services.Configure<Settings.SqlSettings>(Configuration.GetSection("WideWorldImporters"));

        services.AddControllersWithViews();
    }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
            // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
            app.UseHsts();
        }
        app.UseHttpsRedirection();
        app.UseStaticFiles();

        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseAuthentication();
        app.UseAuthorization();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                name: "default",
                pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
        });
    }
}
```

Most of this code is boilerplate, but there are a few things you should note. First, the `Configure` method doesn't pre-populate with `app.UseAuthentication()`, so you will need to add it here.

Next, you set up your Okta middleware in the `ConfigureServices` method. You also register your `WideWorldImporters` SQL configuration in this method.

To consume the `WideWorldImporters` in your controller, you will need to let .NET Core inject it, and then use it. You can see how this is done in the `DashboardController`. Add a file to your `Controllers` folder called `DashboardController.cs`, and replace the code with the following:

```csharp
public class DashboardController : Controller
{
    IOptions<Settings.SqlSettings> _sqlSettings;

    public DashboardController(IOptions<Settings.SqlSettings> sqlSettings)
    {
        _sqlSettings = sqlSettings;
    }

    [Authorize]
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View(getDashboardIndexModel());
    }

    protected Models.DashboardIndexViewModel getDashboardIndexModel()
    {
        DataTable dt = new DataTable();

        string cmdText = 
            @"WITH customer_items (CustomerID, StockItemId, Quantity, 
            LineProfit) AS (    SELECT 
                    CustomerID, 
                    StockItemId, 
                    SUM (Quantity) AS Quantity, 
                    SUM (LineProfit) AS LineProfit 
                 FROM 
                    [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[Invoices] 
                    INNER JOIN [WideWorldImporters].[Sales].[InvoiceLines] ON [Invoices].[InvoiceID] = [InvoiceLines].[InvoiceID] 
                GROUP BY 
                    CustomerID, 
                    StockItemID
            ) 
            SELECT 
                CustomerName, 
                customer_items.Quantity, 
                customer_items.LineProfit, 
                [Warehouse].[StockItems].[StockItemName] 
            FROM 
                customer_items 
                INNER JOIN [Sales].[Customers] ON [Sales].[Customers].[CustomerId] = customer_items.CustomerID 
                INNER JOIN [Warehouse].[StockItems] ON customer_items.StockItemId = [Warehouse].[StockItems].[StockItemID]";

        SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter(cmdText, new SqlConnection(_sqlSettings.Value.ConnectionString));

        da.Fill(dt);

        return new Models.DashboardIndexViewModel(dt);
    }
}
```

The application is injecting the `IOptions<Settings.SqlSettings>` object into this controller. You can reference it later to obtain the connection string for your database. Speaking of your database, this controller also contains the logic for building the model for your view. You will add the model momentarily, but for now, you notice that you are using `ADO.Net` to call the CTE you wrote earlier. This works just as well with Dapper or Entity Framework; ADO.Net was chosen here because it's the simplest to set up.

Add a new class to the `Models` folder called DashboardIndexViewModel and add the following code to it:

```csharp
public class DashboardIndexViewModel
{
    public List<DashboardLineItem> Items { get; set; }

    public DashboardIndexViewModel(System.Data.DataTable items)
    {
        Items = new List<DashboardLineItem>();

        foreach (System.Data.DataRow row in items.Rows)
        {
            Items.Add(
                new DashboardLineItem(
                    row["CustomerName"].ToString(),
                    Convert.ToInt32(row["Quantity"]),
                    Convert.ToDecimal(row["LineProfit"]),
                    row["StockItemName"].ToString()
                    )
                );
        }
    }
}

public class DashboardLineItem
{
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public string StockItemName { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public decimal LineProfit { get; set; }

    public DashboardLineItem(string customerName, int quantity, decimal lineProfit, string stockItemName)
    {
        CustomerName = customerName;
        Quantity = quantity;
        LineProfit = lineProfit;
        StockItemName = stockItemName;
    }
}
```

This model is just taking the items from the query you ran earlier and injecting them into a nice view-model for your view.  

Next, add a controller to your `Controllers` folder called `AccountController` if one does exist. Replace the code with the following.

```csharp
public class AccountController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult SignIn()
    {
        if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
        }

        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Dashboard");
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult SignOut()
    {
        return new SignOutResult
        (
            new[]
            {
                    OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                    CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
            },
            new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/Home/" }
        );
    }
}
```

This code will set your application to use Okta authentication. In the `SignIn` method, you look to see if the user is already logged in. If they aren't, you return a challenge which will redirect them to Okta for authentication. Once the user is logged in, they will be directed to the `Dashboard/Index` page. The signout method will redirect users back to the home page.  

Finally, you need to add your views. First, open your `Shared/_Layout.cshtml` file and replace the code with the following.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

                    @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
                    {
                        <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
                            <li>
                                <form class="form-inline" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignOut" method="post">

                                </form>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">

                    }
                </div>
            </nav>
        </header>
        <div class="container">

```

This view has some logic that detects if the user is logged in or not. If the user isn't logged in, you will display a `Login` button to them; if they are already logged in, you'll display a `Logout` button.

Next, open your home page and add the following code to it:

```csharp
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
}

<div class="jumbotron">
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="display-3">Common Table Expressions</h1>

```

There is nothing critical to the application here; it simply provides some extra links for you to read for further learning.

Finally, add or update your `Dashboard/Index.cshtml` view with the following code:

```csharp
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Index";
}

@model CTEsDemo.Models.DashboardIndexViewModel

<table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Customer Name</th>
            <th>Quantity</th>
            <th>Line Profit</th>
            <th>Stock Item Name</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach(var item in Model.Items)
        {
        <tr>
            <td>@item.CustomerName</td>
            <td>@item.Quantity</td>
            <td>@item.LineProfit.ToString("C")</td>
            <td>@item.StockItemName</td>
        </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```
