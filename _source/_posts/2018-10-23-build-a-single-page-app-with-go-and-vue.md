Single-Page Applications (SPAs) improve user experience by offering rich UI interactions, fast feedback, and the relief of knowing you don't need to download and install a traditional application. Browsers are now operating systems and websites are apps. While a SPA isn't always the answer, for apps that rely on snappy user interaction they are increasingly common.

To the end user, a well-designed SPA feels like rainbows and unicorns. From the developer perspective, reality can often be the opposite. Tough problems long-since solved on the backend like authentication, routing, state management, data binding, etc. all become time-consuming frontend challenges. Luckily for us, JavaScript frameworks like Vue, React, and Angular exist to help us craft powerful applications and allow us to focus our time on critical functionality and not reinventing the wheel.

## About Vue.js

Who better to describe Vue than its creator, Evan You?

> Vue (pronounced `/vjuː/`, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

Here are some of Vue's benefits:

- A gentle learning curve and low barrier to entry
- Provides the ability to bootstrap your app with`vue-cli`, saving you the hassle of setting up webpack and complex build pipelines
- Explosive community growth! Vue now has more stars on GitHub than both React *and* Angular
- It's flexible enough to adopt at a reasonable pace, component by component

## Create Your Vue + Go App

In this tutorial, you'll create a single-page application that allows users to show their love for open source projects on GitHub. For the frontend you'll use Vue and popular tooling like `vuex`, `vue-cli`, `vuetify`, and `vue-router`. On the backend, you'll use Go to build a REST API and persist your data in MongoDB.

Authentication and user management can be a major pain, so you'll use JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication when making requests from the SPA and [Okta's Go JWT Verifier](https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang) as a middleware on your backend to validate the user's token on every request.

Once complete, users will be able to authenticate via OpenID Connect (OIDC), search for projects on GitHub, favorite those projects, and even write notes about their favorite projects!

**PS**: Don't want to follow the tutorial? That's fine! Feel free to check out
the finished [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-go-vue-example).

### Create the Vue and Go Directory Structure

For the sake of simplicity, let's create the REST API and SPA in the same project, starting with a project directory in the Go workspace.

Go projects live inside the directory the environment variable `$GOPATH` points to. In order to find the current `$GOPATH` value, run: `go env GOPATH`. To learn more about GOPATH, including how to set it yourself, refer to the official [Go documentation](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) on the topic.

If you're totally new to Go, check out [this article](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) in order to understand how projects are organized inside the GOPATH directory.

With the GOPATH defined, you now can create a directory for your project:

{% raw %}
```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/{{ YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME} }/kudo-oos
```
{% endraw %}

To get your SPA off the ground quickly you can leverage the scaffolding functionality of [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/). The CLI will prompt you with a series of options - pick the technology appropriate for this project: `vue.js`, `vuex`, and, `webpack`.

Install `vue-cli` by running:

```sh
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

If you aren't familiar with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), it's an alternative
to npm that many developers like. To install `yarn` you can run the command
below:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

Next, create a new Vue project:

```bash
mkdir -p pkg/http/web
cd pkg/http/web
vue create app
```

You will be prompted with a series of questions about the project's build details. For this app pick all the default choices.

{% img blog/go-vue/vue-cli.gif alt:"Use the vue-cli to initialize a program" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Congratulations, you have created your Vue.js SPA! Try it out by running:

```bash
cd app
yarn serve
```

Open this URL: <http://localhost:8080> in your browser and you should see the following.

{% img blog/go-vue/vue-default-page.png alt:"Vue default page" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Next, let's make your SPA modern and responsive using `vuetify`.

## Add Vuetify

[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) is a collection of Vue.js components that abstract [Material Design's](https://material.io/design/) concepts. Vuetify provides out-of-the box features including a grid system, typography, basic layout, and also components like cards, dialogs, chips, tabs, icons and so on. Vuetify will pave your way to a rich UI!

When installing vuetify, you will be prompted with a series of questions. For the sake of simplicity just go with the default choices again.

```bash
vue add vuetify
```

{% img blog/go-vue/add-vueify.gif alt:"Add vueify" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Spin up your SPA again to see vuetify in action.

```bash
yarn serve
```


{% img blog/go-vue/vuetify-page.png alt:"Vuetify page" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

## Add Authentication to Your Vue App with Okta

Writing secure user auth and building login pages are easy to get wrong and can be the downfall of a new project. Okta makes it simple to implement all the user management functionality quickly and securely. Get started by signing up for a [free developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) and creating an OIDC application in Okta.

{% img blog/go-vue/okta-sign-up.png alt:"Okta sign-up page" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Once logged in, create a new application by clicking "Add Application".

{% img blog/go-vue/okta-add-application.png alt:"Okta add application" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Select the "Single-Page App" platform option.

{% img blog/go-vue/okta-create-app.png alt:"Okta create application" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

The default application settings should be the same as those pictured.

{% img blog/go-vue/okta-app-settings.png alt:"Okta application settings" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Next, install the Okta Vue SDK by running the following command:

```bash
yarn add @okta/okta-vue@1.0.7
```


## Install Your Vue App Dependencies

You'll also need to install a few dependencies in order to get your project
running. Run the following command to install them all:

```bash
yarn add vue-router@3.0.2
yarn add vuex@3.0.1
yarn add axios@0.18.0
```

- [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/) is a popular routing tool you'll be using to manage app routes
- [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) is what you'll be using to manage page state
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is a popular HTTP library that lets you easily make REST calls

## Create Your Vue App Routes

For this app, you need only 4 routes, all of which require authentication except for the login route.

The root route `/` is our landing page where the login component will be rendered. Once the user has authenticated, we'll redirect them to the `/me` route where the bulk of the functionality takes place: the user should be able to query for OSS projects via GitHub's REST API, favorite projects returned from the query, see more details about the project, and leave a note describing why the project is important to them.

Take note that both the `/me` and `repo/:id` have a `meta: { requiresAuth: true }` property specifying that the user must be authenticated to access that area of the app. The Okta plugin will use it to redirect the user the Okta login page if not authenticated.

First, install the `vue-router` and `vuex` packages.

Now create `pkg/http/web/app/src/routes.js` and define the following routes:

{% raw %}
```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
import Auth from '@okta/okta-vue'

import Home from './components/Home';
import Login from './components/Login';
import GitHubRepoDetails from './components/GitHubRepoDetails';

Vue.use(VueRouter);
Vue.use(Auth, {
  issuer: '{{ OKTA_ORG_URL }}/oauth2/default',
  client_id: '{{ OKTA_APP_CLIENT_ID }}',
  redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:8080/implicit/callback',
  scope: 'openid profile email'
})

export default new VueRouter({
 mode: 'history',
 routes: [
   { path: '/', component: Login },
   { path: '/me', component: Home, meta: { requiresAuth: true }},
   { name: 'repo-details', path: '/repo/:id', component: GitHubRepoDetails, meta: { requiresAuth: true } },
   { path: '/implicit/callback', component: Auth.handleCallback() }
 ]
});
```
{% endraw %}

Calling `Vue.use(Auth, ...)` will inject an `authClient` object into your Vue instance which can be accessed by calling `this.$auth` anywhere inside your Vue instance. This is what you'll use to make sure a user is logged in and/or to force the user to identify themself!

Be sure to replace {% raw %}`{{ OKTA_ORG_URL }}`{% endraw %} with your Okta ORG Url.  This value can be found on the dashboard page of your Okta dashboard (pictured below).

{% img blog/go-vue/okta-org-url.png alt:"Okta Org URL" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

You'll also need to replace {% raw %}`{{ OKTA_APP_CLIENT_ID }}`{% endraw %} with your new Okta app's Client ID. If you navigate back to your newly created application, you should see your Client ID value on the **General** tab (pictured below).

{% img blog/go-vue/okta-app-client-id.png alt:"Okta App Client ID" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Also, note the hard-coded value `http://localhost:8080/implicit/callback`. If you later change your app to run in production on a different URL, you'll need to modify this value. A best practice is to store this value in an environment variable so that depending on where you're running your application, the correct value will be used.

## Create the Vue Components

The `vue-router` library contains a number of components to help developers create dynamic and rich UIs. One of them, `router-view`, renders the component for the matched route. In our case, when the user accesses the root route `/`, `vue-router` will render the `Login` component as configured in `routers.js`.

Open `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app/src/App.vue` and copy in the following code.

{% raw %}
```js
<template>
 <v-app>
   <router-view></router-view>
   <Footer />
 </v-app>
</template>

<script>
import Footer from '@/components/Footer.vue'

export default {
 name: 'App',
 components: { Footer },
 data() {
   return {}
 }
}
</script>
```
{% endraw %}

For every route other than the matched route component, Vue will render the `Footer` component. Create `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app/src/components/Footer.vue` and copy in the following code to create that footer component.

{% raw %}
```js
<template>
 <v-footer class="pa-3 white--text" color="teal" absolute>
   <div>
     Developed with ❤️  by {{YOUR_NAME}} &copy; {{ new Date().getFullYear() }}
   </div>
 </v-footer>
</template>
```
{% endraw %}

Next, create the `Login` component. Create `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app/src/components/Login.vue` and copy in the following code.

{% raw %}
```javascript
<template>
  <v-app id="inspire">
    <v-content>
      <v-container fluid fill-height>
        <v-layout align-center justify-center>
          <v-flex xs12 sm8 md4>
            <v-card class="elevation-12">
              <v-toolbar dark color="teal">
                <v-toolbar-title justify-center>Login</v-toolbar-title>
              </v-toolbar>
              <v-card-text>
                <v-btn @click.prevent="login" color="primary">Sign in with Okta</v-btn>
              </v-card-text>
            </v-card>
          </v-flex>
        </v-layout>
      </v-container>
    </v-content>
  </v-app>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {};
  },
  async mounted() {
    const isAuthenticated = await this.$auth.isAuthenticated();
    isAuthenticated && this.$router.push('/me');
  },
  methods: {
    login () {
      this.$auth.loginRedirect('/me')
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
{% endraw %}

This Login component will eventually render a "sign in" button on the homepage of the website when a user visits the page who isn't logged in. The home page will eventually look like the following:

{% img blog/go-vue/vue-landing-page.png alt:"Vue landing page" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

Once the login component is rendered, the user will be redirected to the login page after clicking the sign in button.

{% img blog/go-vue/okta-sign-in.png alt:"Okta sign-in" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

And after a successful login, the user will be redirected back to your application to the configured route. In our app, that's the `/me` route.

{% img blog/go-vue/vue-app.png alt:"Vue app" width:"600" %}{: .center-image }

The `/me` route was configured to render the `Home` component, which in turn renders the Sidebar, Kudos, and Search tabs. Each tab renders a specific set of `GitHubRepo`s. Let's create these components now.

Create the `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app/src/components/Home.vue` component.

{% raw %}
```js
<template>
  <div>
    <SearchBar defaultQuery='okta' v-on:search-submitted="githubQuery" />
    <v-container grid-list-md fluid class="grey lighten-4" >
         <v-tabs
        slot="extension"
        v-model="tabs"
        centered
        color="teal"
        text-color="white"
        slider-color="white"
      >
        <v-tab class="white--text" :key="2">
          KUDOS
        </v-tab>
        <v-tab class="white--text" :key="1">
          SEARCH
        </v-tab>
      </v-tabs>
        <v-tabs-items style="width:100%" v-model="tabs">
          <v-tab-item :key="2">
            <v-layout row wrap>
              <v-flex v-for="kudo in allKudos" :key="kudo.id" md4 >
                <GitHubRepo :repo="kudo" />
              </v-flex>
            </v-layout>
          </v-tab-item>
          <v-tab-item :key="1">
            <v-layout row wrap>
              <v-flex v-for="repo in repos" :key="repo.id" md4>
                <GitHubRepo :repo="repo" />
              </v-flex>
            </v-layout>
          </v-tab-item>
        </v-tabs-items>
    </v-container>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import SearchBar from './SearchBar.vue'
import GitHubRepo from './GitHubRepo.vue'
import githubClient from '../githubClient'
import { mapMutations, mapGetters, mapActions } from 'vuex'

export default {
  name: 'Home',
  components: { SearchBar, GitHubRepo },
  data() {
    return {
      tabs: 0
    }
  },
  computed: mapGetters(['allKudos', 'repos']),
  created() {
    this.getKudos();
  },
  methods: {
    githubQuery(query) {
      this.tabs = 1;
      githubClient
        .getJSONRepos(query)
        .then(response => this.resetRepos(response.items) )
    },
    ...mapMutations(['resetRepos']),
    ...mapActions(['getKudos']),
  },
}
</script>

<style>
 .v-tabs__content {
   padding-bottom: 2px;
 }
</style>
```
{% endraw %}

`SearchBar` is the first component rendered in `Home`. When the user enters a query into the text input in the `Sidebar`, this component triggers a call to the GitHub API. `SearchBar` simply emits an event to its parent, `Home`, which contains the `githubQuery`.

Create `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app/src/components/SearchBar.vue` and copy in the following code:

{% raw %}
```js
<template>
    <v-toolbar dark color="teal">
      <v-spacer></v-spacer>
      <v-text-field
        solo-inverted
        flat
        hide-details
        label="Search for your OOS project on GitHub + Press Enter"
        prepend-inner-icon="search"
        v-model="query"
        @keyup.enter="onSearchSubmition"
      ></v-text-field>
      <v-spacer></v-spacer>
      <button @click.prevent="logout">Logout</button>
    </v-toolbar>
</template>

<script>
export default {
    data() {
      return {
        query: null,
      };
    },
    props: ['defaultQuery'],
    methods: {
      onSearchSubmition() {
        this.$emit('search-submitted', this.query);
      },
      async logout () {
        await this.$auth.logout()
        this.$router.push('/')
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
{% endraw %}

Thanks to `@keyup.enter="onSearchSubmition"`, whenever the user hits enter `onSearchSubmition` emits `search-submitted` with the query value. How do we capture this event you may ask? Simple! On the Home component, when you mounted the `Sidebar` component you also added a "listener" `v-on:search-submitted="githubQuery"` that calls `githubQuery` on every `search-submitted` event.

The `Sidebar` is also responsible for logging the user out. Okta Vue SDK offers a handy method to clean up the session using the method `this.$auth.logout()`. Whenever the user logs out,  they can be redirected to the login page.

The second component rendered in `Home` is the `GitHubRepo`. This component is used inside two tabs: the first tab `Kudos` represents the user's favorites OSS projects and the `Search` tab renders the OSS projects returned from GitHub.

Create `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app/src/components/GitHubRepo.vue` and copy in the following code:

{% raw %}
```js
<template>
  <v-card >
    <v-card-title primary-title>
      <div class="repo-card-content">
        <h3 class="headline mb-0">
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'repo-details', params: { id: repo.id }}" >{{repo.full_name}}</router-link>
        </h3>
        <div>{{repo.description}}</div>
      </div>
    </v-card-title>
    <v-card-actions>
      <v-chip>
        {{repo.language}}
      </v-chip>
      <v-spacer></v-spacer>
      <v-btn @click.prevent="toggleKudo(repo)"  flat icon color="pink">
        <v-icon v-if="isKudo(repo)">favorite</v-icon>
        <v-icon v-else>favorite_border</v-icon>
      </v-btn>
    </v-card-actions>
  </v-card>
</template>

<script>
import { mapActions } from 'vuex';

export default {
  data() {
    return {}
  },
  props: ['repo'],
  methods: {
    isKudo(repo) {
      return this.$store.getters.isKudo(repo);
    },
    ...mapActions(['toggleKudo'])
  }
}
</script>

<style>
 .repo-card-content {
   height: 90px;
   overflow: scroll;
 }
</style>
```
{% endraw %}

Your SPA uses `vuex` to manage state in one centralized store accessible by all components. `Vuex` also ensures that access to the store is performed in a predictable fashion respecting a few rules. To read the state, you need to define `getters`, synchronous changes to the state must be done via `mutations`, and asynchronous changes are done via `actions`.

You now need to create `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app/src/store.js` with `actions`, `mutations` and `getters`. Your initial data is {% raw %}`{ kudos: {}, repos: [] }`{% endraw %}. `kudos` holds all the user's favorites OSS projects as a JavaScript Object where the key is the project id and the value is the project itself. `repos` is an array that holds the search results.

There are two cases in which you may need to mutate state. First, when the user logs in you need to fetch the user's  favorites OSS projects from the Go server and set the `repos` in the store by calling `resetRepos`. Second, when the user favorites or unfavorites an OSS project, you need update the `kudos` in the store by calling `resetKudos` to reflect that change on the server.

`resetKudos` is synchronous method that is called by `actions` inside asynchronous functions after each call to the Go server.

The `Home` component uses the `getters` `allKudos` and `repos` to render the list of Kudos and SearchResults. In order to know whether a `repo` has been favorited or not, your app needs to call the `isKudo` getter.

Create the `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app/src/store.js` file and copy in the code below:

{% raw %}
```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

import APIClient from './apiClient';

Vue.use(Vuex);

const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    kudos: {},
    repos: [],
  },
  mutations: {
    resetRepos (state, repos) {
      state.repos = repos;
    },
    resetKudos(state, kudos) {
      state.kudos = kudos;
    }
  },
  getters: {
    allKudos(state) {
      return Object.values(state.kudos);
    },
    kudos(state) {
      return state.kudos;
    },
    repos(state) {
      return state.repos;
    },
    isKudo(state) {
      return (repo)=> {
        return !!state.kudos[repo.id];
      };
    }
  },
  actions: {
    getKudos ({commit}) {
      APIClient.getKudos().then((data) => {
        commit('resetKudos', data.reduce((acc, kudo) => {
                               return {[kudo.id]: kudo, ...acc}
                             }, {}))
      })
    },
    updateKudo({ commit, state }, repo) {
      const kudos = { ...state.kudos, [repo.id]: repo };

      return APIClient
        .updateKudo(repo)
        .then(() => {
          commit('resetKudos', kudos)
        });
    },
    toggleKudo({ commit, state }, repo) {
      if (!state.kudos[repo.id]) {
        return APIClient
          .createKudo(repo)
          .then(kudo => commit('resetKudos', { [kudo.id]: kudo, ...state.kudos }))
      }

      const kudos = Object.entries(state.kudos).reduce((acc, [repoId, kudo]) => {
                      return (repoId == repo.id) ? acc
                                                 : { [repoId]: kudo, ...acc };
                    }, {});

      return APIClient
        .deleteKudo(repo)
        .then(() => commit('resetKudos', kudos));
    }
  }
});

export default store;
```
{% endraw %}

Inside `actions` you are performing ajax calls to the Go server. Every request made to the server must be authenticated or the server will respond with a client error. When the user logs in, an access token is created and can be accessed by calling: `await Vue.prototype.$auth.getAccessToken()`. This asynchronous function returns an access token required to send authenticated requests to the server.

The Go server exposes a REST API for the `kudo` resource. You will implement methods to make ajax calls in order to create with `createKudo`, update with `updateKudo`, delete with `deleteKudo`, and list all kudos with `getKudos`. Notice that these methods call the `perform` method by passing the endpoint and the HTTP verb. `perform`, in turn, populates the request `Authorization` header with the access token so the Go server can validate the request.

Create `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app/src/apiClient.js` and copy in the code below.

{% raw %}
```js
import Vue from 'vue';
import axios from 'axios';

const BASE_URI = 'http://localhost:4444';
const client = axios.create({
  baseURL: BASE_URI,
  json: true
});

const APIClient =  {
  createKudo(repo) {
    return this.perform('post', '/kudos', repo);
  },

  deleteKudo(repo) {
    return this.perform('delete', `/kudos/${repo.id}`);

  },

  async perform (method, resource, data) {
    let accessToken = await Vue.prototype.$auth.getAccessToken()
    return client({

      }
    }).then(req => {
      return req.data
    })
  }
}

export default APIClient;
```
{% endraw %}

Also, create`./kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app/src/githubClient.js` and copy in the code below. This file contains helper functions used to interact with the GitHub API.

{% raw %}
```js
const API_URL = "https://api.github.com/search/repositories"
export default {
  getJSONRepos(query) {
    return fetch(`${API_URL}?q=` + query).then(response => response.json());
  }
}
```
{% endraw %}

Each `GitHubRepo` has a `router-link` to `/repo/:id` that renders the `GitHubRepoDetails` component. `GitHubRepoDetails` shows details about the OSS project, like how many times the project has been of starred and the amount of open issues. The user can also leave a note describing why the project is special by clicking the Kudo button. The message is sent to Go server button by calling `updateKudo`.

Create the `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app/src/components/GitHubRepoDetails.js` file with the code below.

{% raw %}
```js

{% endraw %}

Now that your router, store, and components are in place, go ahead and modify `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app/src/main.js` to properly initialize your SPA. Copy in the following code and overwrite whatever is there.

{% raw %}
```js
import '@babel/polyfill'
import Vue from 'vue'
import './plugins/vuetify'
import App from './App.vue'
import store from './store'
import router from './routes'

Vue.config.productionTip = process.env.NODE_ENV == 'production';

router.beforeEach(Vue.prototype.$auth.authRedirectGuard())

new Vue({
  store,
  router,
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')
```
{% endraw %}

Note that we are calling `router.beforeEach(Vue.prototype.$auth.authRedirectGuard())` to look for routes tagged with {% raw %}`meta: {requiresAuth: true}`{% endraw %} and redirect the user to the authentication flow if they are not logged in.

## Create a REST API with Go

Now that users can securely authenticate on the frontend, you need to create a HTTP server written in Go to handle the requests, handle user authentication, and perform CRUD operations.

The first code you need to create is a structure to represent a GitHub repository. Start by creating `./kudo-oos/pkg/core/kudo.go`.

```bash
mkdir pkg/core
```

Now define the following struct to represent a "kudo" (someone giving kudos to a specific repo). Copy the code below into your newly created file, `./kudo-oos/pkg/core/kudo.go`.

{% raw %}
```go
package core

// Kudo represents a oos kudo.
type Kudo struct {
        UserID      string `json:"user_id" bson:"userId"`
        RepoID      string `json:"id" bson:"repoId"`
        RepoName    string `json:"full_name" bson:"repoName"`
        RepoURL     string `json:"html_url" bson:"repoUrl"`
        Language    string `json:"language" bson:"language"`
        Description string `json:"description" bson:"description"`
        Notes       string `json:"notes" bson:"notes"`
}
```
{% endraw %}

Next, create the `./kudo-oos/pkg/core/repository.go` file and add the following interface to represent an API for any persistence layer you might want to use. In this article, we are going to use MongoDB.

{% raw %}
```go
package core

// Repository defines the API repository implementation should follow.
type Repository interface {
        Find(id string) (*Kudo, error)
        FindAll(selector map[string]interface{}) ([]*Kudo, error)
        Delete(kudo *Kudo) error
        Update(kudo *Kudo) error
        Create(kudo ...*Kudo) error
        Count() (int, error)
}
```
{% endraw %}

Finally, create the MongoDB repository that implements the interface you've just created. First, create a new directory to hold this code.

```bash
mkdir pkg/storage
```

Then create the file `./kudo-oos/pkg/storage/mongo.go` and add the following code.

{% raw %}
```go
package storage

import (
        "log"
        "os"
        "github.com/globalsign/mgo"
        "github.com/globalsign/mgo/bson"
        "github.com/klebervirgilio/vue-crud-app-with-golang/pkg/core"
)

const (
        collectionName = "kudos"
)

func GetCollectionName() string {
        return collectionName
}

type MongoRepository struct {
        logger  *log.Logger
        session *mgo.Session
}

// Find fetches a kudo from mongo according to the query criteria provided.
func (r MongoRepository) Find(repoID string) (*core.Kudo, error) {
        session := r.session.Copy()
        defer session.Close()
        coll := session.DB("").C(collectionName)

        var kudo core.Kudo
        err := coll.Find(bson.M{"repoId": repoID, "userId": kudo.UserID}).One(&kudo)
        if err != nil {
                r.logger.Printf("error: %v\n", err)
                return nil, err
        }
        return &kudo, nil
}

// FindAll fetches all kudos from the database. YES.. ALL! be careful.
func (r MongoRepository) FindAll(selector map[string]interface{}) ([]*core.Kudo, error) {
        session := r.session.Copy()
        defer session.Close()
        coll := session.DB("").C(collectionName)

        var kudos []*core.Kudo
        err := coll.Find(selector).All(&kudos)
        if err != nil {
                r.logger.Printf("error: %v\n", err)
                return nil, err
        }
        return kudos, nil
}

// Delete deletes a kudo from mongo according to the query criteria provided.
func (r MongoRepository) Delete(kudo *core.Kudo) error {
        session := r.session.Copy()
        defer session.Close()
        coll := session.DB("").C(collectionName)

        return coll.Remove(bson.M{"repoId": kudo.RepoID, "userId": kudo.UserID})
}

// Update updates an kudo.
func (r MongoRepository) Update(kudo *core.Kudo) error {
        session := r.session.Copy()
        defer session.Close()
        coll := session.DB("").C(collectionName)

        return coll.Update(bson.M{"repoId": kudo.RepoID, "userId": kudo.UserID}, kudo)
}

// Create kudos in the database.
func (r MongoRepository) Create(kudos ...*core.Kudo) error {
        session := r.session.Copy()
        defer session.Close()
        coll := session.DB("").C(collectionName)

        for _, kudo := range kudos {
                _, err := coll.Upsert(bson.M{"repoId": kudo.RepoID, "userId": kudo.UserID}, kudo)
                if err != nil {
                        return err
                }
        }

        return nil
}

// Count counts documents for a given collection
func (r MongoRepository) Count() (int, error) {
        session := r.session.Copy()
        defer session.Close()
        coll := session.DB("").C(collectionName)
        return coll.Count()
}

// NewMongoSession dials mongodb and creates a session.
func newMongoSession() (*mgo.Session, error) {
        mongoURL := os.Getenv("MONGO_URL")
        if mongoURL == "" {
                log.Fatal("MONGO_URL not provided")
        }
        return mgo.Dial(mongoURL)
}

func newMongoRepositoryLogger() *log.Logger {
        return log.New(os.Stdout, "[mongoDB] ", 0)
}

func NewMongoRepository() core.Repository {
        logger := newMongoRepositoryLogger()
        session, err := newMongoSession()
        if err != nil {
                logger.Fatalf("Could not connect to the database: %v\n", err)
        }

        return MongoRepository{
                session: session,
                logger:  logger,
        }
}
```
{% endraw %}

## Add the Go Backend

Before you can create HTTP handlers, you'll need to write code to handle incoming request payloads.

First, create the necessary directory:

```bash
mkdir pkg/kudo
```

Then, create the file `./kudo-oos/pkg/kudo/service.go` and insert the code below.

{% raw %}
```go
package kudo

import (
  "strconv"
  "github.com/{{ YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME }}/kudo-oos/pkg/core"
)

type GitHubRepo struct {
  RepoID      int64  `json:"id"`
  RepoURL     string `json:"html_url"`
  RepoName    string `json:"full_name"`
  Language    string `json:"language"`
  Description string `json:"description"`
  Notes       string `json:"notes"`
}

type Service struct {
  userId string
  repo   core.Repository
}

func (s Service) GetKudos() ([]*core.Kudo, error) {
  return s.repo.FindAll(map[string]interface{}{"userId": s.userId})
}

func (s Service) CreateKudoFor(githubRepo GitHubRepo) (*core.Kudo, error) {
  kudo := s.githubRepoToKudo(githubRepo)
  err := s.repo.Create(kudo)
  if err != nil {
    return nil, err
  }
  return kudo, nil
}

func (s Service) UpdateKudoWith(githubRepo GitHubRepo) (*core.Kudo, error) {
  kudo := s.githubRepoToKudo(githubRepo)
  err := s.repo.Create(kudo)
  if err != nil {
    return nil, err
  }
  return kudo, nil
}

func (s Service) RemoveKudo(githubRepo GitHubRepo) (*core.Kudo, error) {
  kudo := s.githubRepoToKudo(githubRepo)
  err := s.repo.Delete(kudo)
  if err != nil {
    return nil, err
  }
  return kudo, nil
}

func (s Service) githubRepoToKudo(githubRepo GitHubRepo) *core.Kudo {
  return &core.Kudo{
    UserID:      s.userId,
    RepoID:      strconv.Itoa(int(githubRepo.RepoID)),
    RepoName:    githubRepo.RepoName,
    RepoURL:     githubRepo.RepoURL,
    Language:    githubRepo.Language,
    Description: githubRepo.Description,
    Notes:       githubRepo.Notes,
  }
}

func NewService(repo core.Repository, userId string) Service {
  return Service{
    repo:   repo,
    userId: userId,
  }
}
```
{% endraw %}

## Define Go HTTP Handlers

Your REST API exposes the `kudo` resource to support clients like your SPA. A normal SPA will expose endpoints so clients can create, update, delete, and list resources. For instance, when the user logs in, a request is made to fetch all the kudos for the authenticated user via `GET /kudos`.

```
 # Fetches all open source projects favorited by the user
GET /kudos

# Fetches a favorited open source project by id
GET /kudos/:id

# Creates (or favorites) an open source project for the logged in user
POST /kudos

# Updates a favorited open source project
PUT /kudos/:id

# Deletes (or unfavorites) a favorited open source project
DELETE /kudos/:id
```

To support this, you need to create a new file named `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/handlers.go` and define your HTTP handlers using the fabulous [httprouter library](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter).

{% raw %}
```go
package http

import (
  "encoding/json"
  "io/ioutil"
  "net/http"
  "strconv"
  "github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter"
  "github.com/{{ YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME }}/kudo-oos/pkg/core"
  "github.com/{{ YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME }}/kudo-oos/pkg/kudo"
)

type Service struct {
  repo   core.Repository
  Router http.Handler
}

func New(repo core.Repository) Service {
  service := Service{
    repo: repo,
  }

  router := httprouter.New()
  router.GET("/kudos", service.Index)
  router.POST("/kudos", service.Create)
  router.DELETE("/kudos/:id", service.Delete)
  router.PUT("/kudos/:id", service.Update)

  service.Router = UseMiddlewares(router)

  return service
}

func (s Service) Index(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, params httprouter.Params) {
  service := kudo.NewService(s.repo, r.Context().Value("userId").(string))
  kudos, err := service.GetKudos()

  if err != nil {
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
    return
  }
  w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
  json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(kudos)
}

func (s Service) Create(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, params httprouter.Params) {
  service := kudo.NewService(s.repo, r.Context().Value("userId").(string))
  payload, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)

  githubRepo := kudo.GitHubRepo{}
  json.Unmarshal(payload, &githubRepo)

  kudo, err := service.CreateKudoFor(githubRepo)

  if err != nil {
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
    return
  }
  w.WriteHeader(http.StatusCreated)
  json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(kudo)
}

func (s Service) Delete(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, params httprouter.Params) {
  service := kudo.NewService(s.repo, r.Context().Value("userId").(string))

  repoID, _ := strconv.Atoi(params.ByName("id"))
  githubRepo := kudo.GitHubRepo{RepoID: int64(repoID)}

  _, err := service.RemoveKudo(githubRepo)
  if err != nil {
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
    return
  }
  w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
}

func (s Service) Update(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, params httprouter.Params) {
  service := kudo.NewService(s.repo, r.Context().Value("userId").(string))
  payload, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)

  githubRepo := kudo.GitHubRepo{}
  json.Unmarshal(payload, &githubRepo)

  kudo, err := service.UpdateKudoWith(githubRepo)
  if err != nil {
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
    return
  }
  w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
  json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(kudo)
}
```
{% endraw %}

## Verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) with Go

This is the most crucial component of your REST API server. Without this middleware, any user can perform CRUD operations against the database.

In the event that no valid JWT is provided in the HTTP authorization header, the API call will be aborted and an error will be returned to the client.

Create `./kudo-oos/pkg/http/middlewares.go` and paste in the following code:

{% raw %}
```go
package http

import (
  "context"
  "log"
  "net/http"
  "strings"
  jwtverifier "github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang"
  "github.com/rs/cors"
)

func OktaAuth(h http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    accessToken := r.Header["Authorization"]
    jwt, err := validateAccessToken(accessToken)
    if err != nil {
      w.WriteHeader(http.StatusForbidden)
      w.Write([]byte(err.Error()))
      return
    }
    ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), "userId", jwt.Claims["sub"].(string))
    h.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
  })
}

func validateAccessToken(accessToken []string) (*jwtverifier.Jwt, error) {
  parts := strings.Split(accessToken[0], " ")
  jwtVerifierSetup := jwtverifier.JwtVerifier{
    Issuer:           "{DOMAIN}",
    ClaimsToValidate: map[string]string{"aud": "api://default", "cid": "{CLIENT_ID}"},
  }
  verifier := jwtVerifierSetup.New()
  return verifier.VerifyIdToken(parts[1])
}

func JSONApi(h http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    h.ServeHTTP(w, r)
  })
}

func AccsessLog(h http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    log.Printf("%s: %s", r.Method, r.RequestURI)
    h.ServeHTTP(w, r)
  })
}

func Cors(h http.Handler) http.Handler {
  corsConfig := cors.New(cors.Options{
    AllowedHeaders: []string{"Origin", "Accept", "Content-Type", "X-Requested-With", "Authorization"},
    AllowedMethods: []string{"POST", "PUT", "GET", "PATCH", "OPTIONS", "HEAD", "DELETE"},
    Debug:          true,
  })
  return corsConfig.Handler(h)
}

func UseMiddlewares(h http.Handler) http.Handler {
  h = JSONApi(h)
  h = OktaAuth(h)
  h = Cors(h)
  return AccsessLog(h)
}
```
{% endraw %}

As you can see, the middleware `OktaAuth` uses [okta-jwt-verifier-golang](https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang) to validate the user's access token.

## Define Your Go REST API Entry Point

Now create a new folder to hold the main Go application:

```bash
mkdir cmd
```

Then create the file `./kudo-oos/cmd/main.go` and add the following code to spin up your Go web server.

{% raw %}
```go
package main

import (
  "log"
  "net/http"
  "os"
  web "github.com/{{ YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME }}/kudo-oos/pkg/http"
  "github.com/{{ YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME }}/kudo-oos/pkg/storage"
)

func main() {
  httpPort := os.Getenv("PORT")

  repo := storage.NewMongoRepository()
  webService := web.New(repo)

  log.Printf("Running on port %s\n", httpPort)
  log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(httpPort, webService.Router))
}
```
{% endraw %}

Next, create a folder to hold your DB initialization code.

```bash
mkdir cmd/db
```

Then create a new file, `./kudo-oos/cmd/db/setup.go` and insert the following code.

{% raw %}
```go
package main

import (
        "log"
        "os"
        "github.com/globalsign/mgo"
)

func main() {
        var err error
        mongoURL := os.Getenv("MONGO_URL")
        if mongoURL == "" {
                log.Fatal("MONGO_URL not provided")
        }
        session, err := mgo.Dial(mongoURL)
        defer session.Close()

        err = session.DB("").AddUser("mongo_user", "mongo_secret", false)

        info := &mgo.CollectionInfo{}
        err = session.DB("").C("kudos").Create(info)

        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }
}
```
{% endraw %}

## Manage Dependencies

I like using the [dep tool](https://github.com/golang/dep) to manage dependencies, so be sure to [install it](https://github.com/golang/dep#installation) before continuing.

Next, run the following commands to initialize the dep tool and create a
`Gopkg.lock` and `Gopkg.toml` file (which will hold dependency resolution
information).

```bash
dep init
dep ensure -add github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang
dep ensure -add github.com/rs/cors
dep ensure -add github.com/globalsign/mgo
```

## Run the Go + Vue SPA

There are many ways to run back-end and front-end apps. The simplest way (for development purposes) is to just use good old fashioned [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Introduction.html).

A Makefile contains build instructions for your website. It's like an old-school version of `gulp`, `grunt`, and the more hip Node tools. To get started, create a file named `Makefile` in the root of your project folder and copy in the following code.

{% raw %}
```
setup: run_services
	@go run ./cmd/db/setup.go

run_services:
	@docker-compose up --build -d

run_server:
	@MONGO_URL=mongodb://mongo_user:mongo_secret@0.0.0.0:27017/kudos PORT=:4444 go run cmd/main.go

run_client:
	@/bin/bash -c "cd $$GOPATH/src/github.com/{{ YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME }}/kudo-oos/pkg/http/web/app && yarn serve"
```
{% endraw %}

### Create a Dockerfile

Next, you'll want to create a Dockerfile. This file tells Docker how to run your application and spares you the effort of deploying a real MongoDB instance for testing purposes.

If you don't already have them installed, go install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose).

Then create a file named `docker-compose.yml` and copy in the following code.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    restart: always
    ports:
     - "27017:27017"
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: mongo_user
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: mongo_secret
```

Your app is now ready to test! Run the following commands to get going.

```bash
make setup
make run_server
make run_client
```

Your Go webserver should be listening on `0.0.0.0:4444` and your SPA should be serving files from `http://localhost:8080`. Visit `http://localhost:8080` to play around with your new app!
