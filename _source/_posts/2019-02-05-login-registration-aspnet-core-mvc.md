User authentication and authorization are common features in web applications, but building these mechanics has the potential to take a lot of time. Doing so requires setting up persistent storage for user information (in some type of database) and paying keen attention to potential security issues around sensitive operations like hashing passwords, password reset workflows, etc. - weeks of development time begin to add up before we ever get to the functionality that delivers value to your users.

In this post, we'll walk through how Okta simplifies this process for us and set up a simple integration for an ASP.NET Core MVC app using the Okta NuGet package. We'll build functionality for users to register for new accounts and login with their Okta credentials.

## Scaffold Your ASP.NET Project
To follow along with this tutorial start by creating a new app in the console:

```sh
mkdir MyOktaProject
cd MyOktaProject
dotnet new mvc
```

## Configure User Registration
If you don't already have one, you'll need to [create an Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/). Doing so will give you a URL for your organization called an "Okta domain". It will also allow you to create your login credentials for accessing the Okta dashboard.

Upon submission of this form, you will receive an email Okta with instructions to obtain your credentials and complete your registration. 

Execute the following steps to configure Okta so that users can register themselves for an account.

1. From the Administrative Dashboard, hover over Users and click **Registration**
2. Click **Enable Registration**
3. Save the changes

{% img blog/login-reg-mvc/okta-reg-settings.png alt:"Registration Settings" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## Configure Basic User Authentication
Once you have access to your account you can proceed to the Dashboard using a link like the one below:

`https://{yourOktaDomain}/admin/dashboard`

On the Dashboard, click **Applications** in the main menu and on the Application screen, click **Add Application**.

{% img blog/login-reg-mvc/okta-add-application.png alt:"Okta Add Application" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Select **Web** then click **Next**.

{% img blog/login-reg-mvc/okta-new-web-app.png alt:"Okta New Web Application" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

On the Create New Application screen, set the following values:

* Base URIs: `https://localhost:5001/`
* Login redirect URIs: `https://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback`

{% img blog/login-reg-mvc/okta-app-settings.png alt:"Okta Application Settings" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Click **Done**, then click **Edit** next to General Settings on your newly created Okta app. Edit the following values:

Logout redirect URIs:
`https://localhost:5001/signout-callback-oidc`

Initiate login URI:
`https://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback`


## Add .NET Authentication Dependencies
Once your account is set up you need to [add the Okta.Sdk library to your project](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-dotnet). This post will take the approach of using the NuGet package, but the Github repository for Okta.AspNetCore can be [found here](https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-dotnet).

To proceed simply search for the latest version of the `Okta.Sdk` NuGet package in your IDE of choice (version 1.2.0 at the time of this publication) and install it. If you're using Visual Studio you can do this by right-clicking on the project in the _solution explorer_ and selecting **Manage NuGet Packages**. For those of you not using Visual Studio, add the package via console window using the following command:

```sh
dotnet add package Okta.Sdk --version 1.2.0
```

## Configure Your ASP.NET App for Login
Authentication works by redirecting users to the Okta website, where they will log in with their credentials, and then be returned to your site via the URL you configured above.

Add the following code to your appsettings.json file:


```json
  "Okta": {
    "Issuer": "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}"
  }
```

You can find each of the actual values needed to replace the settings in the config above in the following places:

**_ClientId_** refers to the client ID of the Okta application
**_ClientSecret_** refers to the client secret of the Okta application
**_Issuer_** will need the text {yourOktaDomain} replaced with your Okta domain, found at the top-right of the Dashboard page

Add some `using` statements to your `Startup.cs` file:

```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;
```

Add the following code to the top of the `ConfigureServices` method in your `Startup.cs` file:

```cs
services.AddAuthentication(sharedOptions =>
{
    sharedOptions.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    sharedOptions.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    sharedOptions.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
    .AddCookie()
    .AddOpenIdConnect(options =>
    {
        options.ClientId = Configuration["okta:ClientId"];
        options.ClientSecret = Configuration["okta:ClientSecret"];
        options.Authority = Configuration["okta:Issuer"];
        options.CallbackPath = "/authorization-code/callback";
        options.ResponseType = "code";
        options.SaveTokens = true;
        options.UseTokenLifetime = false;
        options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
        options.Scope.Add("openid");
        options.Scope.Add("profile");
        options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
        {
            NameClaimType = "name"
        };
    });
```

In the `Configure()` method of your `Startup.cs` file add this line just before the `app.UseMvc()` method:

```cs
app.UseAuthentication();
```

Add the following `MeViewModel` to the _Models_ directory:

```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace OktaAspNetCoreMvc.Models
{
    public class MeViewModel
    {
        public string Username { get; set; }

        public bool SdkAvailable { get; set; }

        public dynamic UserInfo { get; set; }

        public IEnumerable<string> Groups { get; set; }
    }
}
```

## Add Login to Your ASP.NET App

Now that all the configuration and plumbing is done, you're ready to add the code that will actually log users into your application.

Add the following `AccountController` to the _Controller_ directory.

The controller exposes the `Login()` action. If the user has already been authenticated, the `Login()` action will redirect them to the home page. Otherwise, it will redirect them to the Okta login screen.

```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Okta.Sdk;

namespace OktaAspNetCoreMvc.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        private readonly IOktaClient _oktaClient;

        public AccountController(IOktaClient oktaClient = null)
        {
            _oktaClient = oktaClient;
        }

        public IActionResult Login()
        {
            if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return Challenge(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }
    }
}
```

Add the following code to your `_Layout.cshtml` file, just below the main menu to add the login button, or a welcome message, based on the current user's status.:

```html
   @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
            <li><p class="navbar-text">Hello, @User.Identity.Name</p></li>
        </ul>
    }
    else
    {
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
            <li><a asp-controller="Account" asp-action="Login">Log in</a></li>
        </ul>
    }
```

## Register Users
If you following the instructions above to enable self-service registration the "Don't have an account? Sign Up" message will appear at the bottom of the login form. In the next step, you'll run the application.

{% img blog/login-reg-mvc/login-reg-widget.png alt:"Okta Login and Registration Widget" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

## Log In Using ASP.NET
That's it! To run your solution open up a terminal and enter the following command:

```sh
dotnet run
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:5001` in your browser and enjoy!

In this tutorial, you learned how to add authentication to your ASP.NET Core MVC app and allow users to register for a new account.

The source code for this tutorial is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-aspnetcore-login-registration-example).

Now you have a website with a working login and user registration form. Your website also allows users to recover lost passwords. By repeating these steps you can create a network of tools that your users can access all with the same login.
