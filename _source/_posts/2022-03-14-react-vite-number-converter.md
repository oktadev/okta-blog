Front-end applications are becoming ever bigger and more complex. It is not uncommon for a React app to have hundreds or even thousands of components. As the project size increases, build times become increasingly important. In large projects, you may have to wait up to a minute for the code to be translated and bundled into a production package run in the browser. The compile and load times for the development server are also a big issue for these projects. Changes in the code may only show up in the browser after a few seconds. These wait times have become a bottleneck that slows down development.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) addresses this problem by providing a development server and a lightning-fast build command. Vite, pronounced `/vit/`, is French for "quick," and this name describes the goal for this tool. The build command uses [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) under the hood, which is preconfigured to create highly optimized code. The development server makes use of browser support for ES modules. Hot Module Replacement will instantly load any codebase changes into the browser.

Vite was originally developed for Vue, but you can also create React and Svelte projects out of the box. In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a TypeScript-based React application using Vite. The application will be a simple number conversion tool that converts decimal numbers to hexadecimal and binary. I won't assume any prior knowledge apart from a familiarity with JavaScript.

**Prerequisites**:

- [Node 14](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com)

## Using Vite to create the TypeScript React application

Before you start, you should have recent versions of Node and npm installed on your system. The first step is to use the Vite command to create a new application. This can be done using the `npm init` command without installing any additional software. Open a terminal in a folder of your choice and run the following command.

```bash
npm init vite@latest vite-number-conversion -- --template react-ts
```

If you are using an older version of `npm` (below version 7), you'll need to modify the command slightly.

```bash
npm init vite@2.8.0 vite-number-conversion --template react-ts
```

This command will generate a new folder `vite-number-conversion` and initialize it with the `react-ts` template. If you are asked to agree to install the `create-vite` package, simply answer with yes. This template creates a React project using TypeScript and all the configuration for tooling required to develop and build the project. Next, navigate into the new project folder and run the command below to install all the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

You will be using the React Router to manage navigation through your single-page app. Run the following command to install the additional dependency.

```bash
npm install -E react-router-dom@5.3.0 @types/react-router-dom@5.3.3
```

Now open your favorite IDE in the project folder. Feel free to browse around a little to get familiar with the code that Vite has generated. If you are familiar with `create-react-app`, you will notice that the differences are not that big on the surface. There is a Vite-specific configuration file, `vite.config.ts`, to tweak Vite's behavior. For now, leave it as it is, but we will get back to this file later.

Your React components are saved as `.tsx` files in the `src/` folder. To keep things organized, create a new folder `src/components` and add a new file `src/components/Home.tsx`. This will be the component to show the application's home page. Paste the following contents into the file.

```tsx
function Home() {
    return <div>
        <h1>Number Converter</h1>
    </div>
}

export default Home;
```

Next, create the component that contains the number conversion tool. Create another file `src/components/Converter.tsx` with the contents below.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Converter() {
    const [value, setValue] = useState<number>();
    const [origin, setOrigin] = useState<string>();
    const isDisabled = (base: string) => (origin !== undefined && origin !== base);
    
    const updateValue = (baseName: string, base: number) => 
        (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
            if (e.target.value === "") {
                setValue((oldValue) => undefined);
                setOrigin((oldOrigin) => undefined);
            } else {
                setValue((oldValue) => {
                    const newValue = parseInt(e.target.value, base);
                    return isNaN(newValue) ? oldValue : newValue;
                });
                setOrigin((oldOrigin) => baseName);
            }
        }

    return <div className="Converter">
        <label>
            Decimal:
            <input type="string" 
                value={value?.toString(10) || ""}
                name="decimal" 
                onChange={updateValue("decimal", 10)} 
                disabled={isDisabled("decimal")}/>
        </label>
        <label>
            Hexadecimal:
            <input type="string" 
                value={value?.toString(16) || ""}
                name="hex" 
                onChange={updateValue("hex", 16)} 
                disabled={isDisabled("hex")}/>
        </label>
        <label>
            Binary:
            <input type="string" 
                value={value?.toString(2) || ""}
                name="binary" 
                onChange={updateValue("binary", 2)} 
                disabled={isDisabled("binary")}/>
        </label>
    </div>
}

export default Converter;
```

The `Converter` component contains three input fields, one for the decimal value, one for the hexadecimal value, and one for the binary value. It also uses two state variables. `value` contains the number that should be converted to the different formats, and `origin` includes the input field's name in which the user has entered a number. The idea is to disable the input elements filled automatically with the converted valuesâ€”the `isDisabled()` callback controls which elements are disabled. 

The `updateValue()` function is a little bit more tricky. It is a function that returns a callback configured with the name and the number-base of the input field. The callback takes the `ChangeEvent` and updates the component state according to the value in the input field. In the functional programming style, higher-order functions like `updateValue()` can provide a mechanism to implement configurable code without creating code repetition.

Next, open `src/main.tsx` and add the Router to the application. At the top of the file, add the following import.

```ts
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
```

Then, modify the render function to look like the code below.

```tsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

To add the routes to the application, open `src/App.tsx` and replace its contents with the following code.

```tsx
import './App.css'
import { Link, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './components/Home';
import Converter from './components/Converter';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <nav>
        <div className="menu">
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Link to="/converter">Converter</Link>
        </div>
      </nav>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/converter" component={Converter} />
      </Switch>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

The application is mostly complete, but it needs some styling. Open `src/App.css` and edit it to match the CSS below.

```css
.App {
  text-align: center;
}

.App nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background-color: #333333;
  color: #ffffff;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.App nav a {
  color: #ffffff;
  text-decoration: none;
  margin-left: 1rem;
  margin-right: 1rem;
}

.Converter {
  text-align: left;
  margin: 1rem 4rem;
}

.Converter label {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.Converter input {
  display: block;
  margin-top: 0.5rem;
}
```

## Start it up and watch it run

Now, the fun begins! You are ready to start the application. Open the terminal in the project folder and run the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you are used to React applications built with `create-react-app`, you might expect to wait a few seconds before the development server starts. With Vite, I see the following message in less than a second.

```
  vite v2.8.4 dev server running at:

  > Local: http://localhost:3000/
  > Network: use `--host` to expose

  ready in 461ms.
```

You can now open your browser at `http://localhost:3000/` and test the application. When I click the **Converter** link in the navigation bar, I see something like this.

{% img blog/react-vite-number-converter/react-vite-application.jpg alt:"The number conversion utility" width:"512" %}{: .center-image }

I opened up the Developer Tools in Chrome to understand how Vite achieves these fast starting-up times. When you open up the **Network** tab and filter by JS requests, you will see many requests to individual JavaScript sources. You will even see the `.tsx` sources you just edited. 

{% img blog/react-vite-number-converter/react-vite-modules.jpg alt:"Vite development server under the hood." width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

I then looked closer at `App.tsx,` and saw what is shown in the above image. When the development server is asked to serve a `.tsx` file, it will compile it on the fly into browser-compatible code. But it keeps all the `import` statements in place and uses the support for ES modules in the newer browsers. This way, the bundling stage is eliminated, and the loading times are significantly reduced.

## Adding authentication with Okta to the application

A secure application needs user authentication to keep unauthorized users out of restricted areas. With Okta, it is easy to add authentication to your Vite application in just a few steps. 

{% include setup/cli.md type="spa" framework="React" loginRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000/callback" logoutRedirectUri="http://localhost:3000" %}

Now you are ready to add the Okta libraries for React into your project. Open the terminal in the project folder and run the following command.

```bash
npm install -E @okta/okta-react@6.4.2 @okta/okta-auth-js@6.1.0
```

Vite needs some help resolving import aliases used by the Okta libraries. To make things work, open `vite.config.ts` and add the following entry to the configuration object.

```ts
resolve: {
  alias: [
    {
      find: "@okta/okta-auth-js",
      replacement: require.resolve("@okta/okta-auth-js/dist/okta-auth-js.umd.js"),
    },
  ],
}
```

If your IDE or build can't resolve `require`, you may need to add the `@types/node` library for the `require` method. In the terminal, add the library by running the following command:

```shell
npm i â€“save-dev @types/node
```

Now, open `src/main.tsx` and add the following code immediately after the `import` statements.

```ts
import { Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: `https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default`,
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: `${window.location.origin}/callback`,
});

function restoreOriginalUri(oktaAuth: OktaAuth, originalUri: string) {
  window.location.replace(
    toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin)
  );
}
```

Here `{yourClientID}` is the client ID that you obtained earlier and `{yourOktaDomain}` is your Okta domain. Next, surround the `BrowserRouter` component with the `Security` component, passing in `oktaAuth` and `restoreOriginalUri` as parameters. The call to the render function should look something like this.

```tsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <App />
      </BrowserRouter>
    </Security>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

Now that you have made the `OktaAuth` object available to your application, you are ready to create a secured route and configure the login process. Open `src/App.tsx` and add the following import.

```ts
import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute } from '@okta/okta-react';
```

Finally, convert the route that serves the `Converter` component to a secured route and add another route that handles the login callback from Okta. The code inside the `Switch` component should resemble the code below.

```tsx
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
  <SecureRoute path="/converter" component={Converter} />
  <Route path="/callback" component={LoginCallback} />
</Switch>
```

Congratulations, you are ready to power up the application again. If it is still not running, run the command below in the terminal.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now, whenever you navigate to the **Converter** route, the application checks if you are authenticated. If not, it will redirect you to the Okta sign-in page, where you can enter your user credentials. After successfully logging in, you are able to access the application page you requested.

## Learn more about React, TypeScript, and Okta 

In this tutorial, I guided you through creating a TypeScript React application using Vite. Vite is a lightning-fast development server and package bundler that leverages modern ES module browser support and Hot Module Replacementâ€”speeding up refresh times after changes to the codebase can significantly improve development productivity. 

As an example, I showed you how to implement a number conversion utility that converts between decimal, hexadecimal, and binary formats. The application was secured using Okta authentication, and you have seen how this can be achieved in just a few lines of code.
