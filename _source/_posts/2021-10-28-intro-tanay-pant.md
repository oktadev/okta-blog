Greetings Oktaverse! I'm Tanay üññ

I have been following Okta for many years, and I am very excited to finally join you all and get a chance to serve this wonderful community. 

First things first, here's a picture of me so that you can recognize me and say hi the next time we meet. üëá

## Who I am and what I've done so far

I started my journey into the world of tech communities and open source back in college when I came across [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/). I got the chance to participate in a lot of their projects and regional community-building initiatives. Over time, I fell in love with writing and have published books on Firefox OS, virtual assistants with Raspberry Pi, and WebVR. 

During my last years in college, I got the chance to join the Tech Speakers program by Mozilla, and I dove head-first into the realm of public speaking. After wrapping up my studies, I moved to Berlin and worked with start-ups like [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), [Crate.io](https://crate.io/), and [n8n](https://n8n.io/).

Before joining Okta, I have been responsible for building a developer relations team from scratch and managing the various facets of developer relations like docs, user on-boarding, support, partnerships, certifications, and community building.

I love geeking out about space exploration, submarines, science, and Lego models. Next on my reading list are:
- **Letters from an Astrophysicist** by Neil deGrasse Tyson
- **Why We Sleep** by Matthew Walker
- **The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups** by Daniel Coyle

Do you have any book recommendations for me? ü§ì

## What I'll be doing at Okta

I am fortunate to have worked with some of the most vibrant developer communities and individuals across the globe. I hope to use all the skills and knowledge I have acquired to help you get started and succeed with Okta.

As a result of my experiences, my operating style in developer relations is motivated by the urge to:
- Share fascinating things that I have recently learned
- Serve my communities by empathetically understanding their pain points
- Enable my communities to be their best selves and become successful

You'll be hearing a lot more from me on topics around security and identity. I am also very excited to work on educational resources for you all in my favorite languages: JavaScript and Python. 

Is there anything you'd like me to create or focus on first? üßë‚ÄçüöÄ
