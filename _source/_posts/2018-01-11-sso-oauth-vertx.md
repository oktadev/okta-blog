Vert.x has continued to gain traction as a contender to the Spring ecosystem, largely due to improved performance and its polyglot accessibility. Fortunately, securing a Vert.x server with industry-leading authentication and authorization is almost as quick and easy as it is in Spring! In just a few minutes, you can have secure single sign-on guarding your server and giving you access to a wealth of information about your users. This tutorial will walk you through that process, as you stand up a new Vert.x server and integrate it with Okta for security and user management.

## A Quick Recap of the 3-Legged OAuth Flow

This example will be using the third-party provider OAuth flow known as the 3-legged flow (the meat of single sign-on). Before launching into the code, a brief refresher of this process might be helpful.

### The problem

I'm a web server, and I want to secure my site and require users to log in. However, writing, maintaining, and managing user identities is a lot of work.

### The solution

Let someone else deal with it. To achieve this, a bit of cooperation is required between me (the web server), my user (perhaps on a web browser), and whoever is handling auth for me (in this example, Okta). These three cooperating participants are the three "legs" of the 3-legged OAuth flow. The process they go through is a three-way handshake:

  1. The user's browser requests a protected resource from me, the web server
  2. I, the web server, decide that the user needs to sign in first. I refuse to service the request, and instead return a 302 redirect response that tells the browser to go visit Okta instead
  3. The browser complies, visits Okta instead, and the user signs in. Okta then returns its own 302 redirect, telling the browser to go back and visit me again... but this time, carrying a secret code
  4. The browser visits me once again, but this time I see that it carries with it this secret code. I now make my own direct call to Okta, exchanging this secret code for sensitive information about the user such as their name, email address, or phone number

The above handshake is what will be happening behind the scenes once this example is completed. Vert.x supplies a handy OAuth library to take care of this entire process for you â€“ all you need to do is configure it and register it appropriately.  That's what this tutorial demonstrates.

As a starter guide, this post assumes only basic familiarity with Java and a few Java essentials such as Maven. If you already have a Vert.x server running, feel free to fast forward to the good stuff: you'll integrate with Okta in the [Configure the Vert.x OAuth Handler](#configure-the-vertx-oauth-handler) section.

The completed code example, including imports and pom.xml, can be found [on Github](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/OktaBlogs/tree/master/VertxAndOkta).

## Start A New Vert.x Server

To kick things off, visit the [Vert.x Starter page](http://start.vertx.io) and generate a new project.  For this tutorial, you can leave all the default values in place, and include the `Vert.x Web`, `OAuth`, and `Vert.x Config` dependencies:

{% img blog/sso-oauth-vertx/vertx-generate.png alt:"Generate a Vert.x project" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

After clicking generate, downloading, and unzipping locally, you should see the following simple directory structure:

{% img blog/sso-oauth-vertx/vertx-project-tree.png alt:"Vert.x project tree" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

And running with `mvn compile exec:java` from the `demo` directory should start the server on port 8080:

{% img blog/sso-oauth-vertx/vertx-compile.png alt:"Vert.x project compiling" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

Visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your browser returns a reassuring hello world response:

{% img blog/sso-oauth-vertx/vertx-hello.png alt:"Vert.x initial hello world page" width:"700" %}{: .center-image }

At this point, a proper next step would be to switch to https before continuing to add authentication. However, to keep the tutorial short and focused, that part will be skipped and the examples will continue to use the unencrypted http server mode.

## Bring in the Vert.x Config

Vert.x offers a versatile config library, albeit a little more work to set up than in Spring. This example will make use of a handful of config values, so you can take this opportunity to add Vert.x Config to your project. The dependency should already be present in your `pom.xml` if you specified Vert.x Config when creating the starter project.

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
   <artifactId>vertx-config</artifactId>
   <version>${vertx.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Create a file called `src/main/application.json` and add the following content:

```json
{
   "clientId": "{okta-client-id}",
   "clientSecret": "{okta-client-secret}",
   "issuer": "https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default",
   "callbackUrl": "http://localhost:8080/login",
   "port": 8080
}
```

You'll be updating those values shortly. Now in `src/main/java/com/example/demo/MainVerticle.java`, replace the contents of the `start()` method with the following, which will load the config. Notice that when it completes, it calls a method called `startServer()` that doesn't exist yet. You will add that in the next section.

```java
@Override
public void start() throws Exception {
   ConfigStoreOptions fileStore = new ConfigStoreOptions()
       .setType("file")
       .setConfig(new JsonObject().put("path", "src/main/application.json"));
   ConfigRetrieverOptions options = new ConfigRetrieverOptions()
       .addStore(fileStore);
   ConfigRetriever retriever = ConfigRetriever.create(vertx, options);
   retriever.getConfig(ar -> {
       if (ar.failed()) {
           System.err.println("failed to retrieve config.");
       } else {
           config().mergeIn(ar.result());
           startServer();
       }
   });
}
```

## Incorporate the Vert.x Router

By leveraging the [Vert.x Router](http://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/ext/web/Router.html), you will be able to easily intercept calls to sensitive endpoints and enforce preauthentication. To do this, you'll now implement  the `startServer()` method in `src/main/java/com/example/demo/MainVerticle.java`:

```java
void startServer() {

    Router router = Router.router(vertx);

    router.route("/private/secret")
	    .handler(ctx -> {
        ctx.response().end("Hi");
    });

    vertx.createHttpServer()
		.requestHandler(router::accept)
		.listen(config().getInteger("port"));
}
```

In the example above, you have created a new endpoint at `/private/secret` with the intent of soon protecting every endpoint under the `/private` path. But first, the Vert.x OAuth handler needs to be set up.

## Create an Okta Account and Gather Credentials

If you don't already have a free Okta account, you can follow [these instructions](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/11/20/add-sso-spring-boot-15-min#get-your-okta-credentials) to create one and set up your first Okta application. There are four key pieces of information you will need to gather:

 - Client Id - e.g.: ***oot9wrjjararhfaa***
 - Client Secret - (keep it secret!)
 - Issuer - e.g.: ***https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default*** ...be sure to include the ***/oauth2/default*** path!
 - Callback Url - this will be ***http://localhost:8080/login*** if you followed the instructions above.

These values can now be used in your `src/main/application.json` file.

## Configure the Vert.x OAuth Handler

Vert.x comes with an out-of-the-box OAuth manager that integrates nicely with Okta as an identity provider.  To keep things tidy, you'll create a separate factory method in `src/main/java/com/example/demo/MainVerticle.java`that produces a configured OAuth handler.  Add the following to the `MainVerticle` class, replacing the client info below with your account details obtained from the Okta developer dashboard:

```java
AuthHandler getOAuthHandler(Router router) {
    OAuth2Auth oauth2 = OAuth2Auth.create(vertx, OAuth2FlowType.AUTH_CODE, new OAuth2ClientOptions()
        .setClientID(config().getString("clientId"))
        .setClientSecret(config().getString("clientSecret"))
        .setSite(config().getString("issuer"))
        .setTokenPath("/v1/token")
        .setAuthorizationPath("/v1/authorize")
        .setUserInfoPath("/v1/userinfo")
        .setUseBasicAuthorizationHeader(false)
    );

    OAuth2AuthHandler authHandler = OAuth2AuthHandler.create(oauth2, config().getString("callbackUrl"));
    authHandler.extraParams(new JsonObject("{\"scope\":\"openid profile email\"}"));
    authHandler.setupCallback(router.route());
    return authHandler;
}
```

In the above example, note the three requested scopes: **openid**, **profile**, and  **email**. Future posts will explore additional scopes and authorization levels, but for now, these three will provide the absolute essentials (such as the user's name and email address). Using the email address, you can also directly query Okta's API for additional information about the user, and to perform account management tasks.

## Intercept and Authorize Protected Endpoints

Now that the `AuthHandler` is prepared, it needs to precede request handling of any protected endpoint and authenticate the user. By using a wildcard to register it as the top-level handler for all paths below `/private/`, it will only need to be dealt with once for all future handlers you might create. Any request handler below the `/private/` path can then be guaranteed that when it is called, it will only be from a properly authenticated user.

Alter the `startServer()` method of the `MainVerticle` class as indicated below to generate and register the handler:

```java
public void startServer() {

    Router router = Router.router(vertx);

    //create and register the auth handler to intercept all
    //requests below the /private/ URI:
    AuthHandler authHandler = getOAuthHandler(router);
    router.route("/private/*").handler(authHandler);

    router.route("/private/secret")
	    .handler(ctx -> {
        ctx.response().end("Hi");
    });

    vertx.createHttpServer()
		.requestHandler(router::accept)
		.listen(config().getString("port"));
}
```

This would be an excellent time to start up the server again and make sure everything is running as expected. By running `mvn compile java:exec` again and hitting `http://localhost:8080/private/secret` from your browser, you should now be automatically redirected to Okta's login page. After logging in, you should then be redirected back to your site to continue responding to the original `/private/secret` request.

## Extract User Info from the JWT

Now that callers to your `/private/` APIs are logged in, the next thing you'll want is their information. This is delivered in the form of a [JSON Web Token](https://www.jsonwebtoken.io/), which must be extracted and decoded. The Vert.x OAuth handler hides this as a named member of a stringified JSON object called the **principal**, which is itself a component of the context's **user** object. That encoded token is then decoded and verified using the JWT library of your choice. This example uses [Okta's JWT verifier library](https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-java).

Both the `access_token` and `id_token` are available, but this tutorial will only decode the `id_token`. There is a similar function to decode the `access_token` if needed.  To accomplish this, include the Okta JWT lib dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.okta.jwt</groupId>
    <artifactId>okta-jwt-verifier</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```
...and add the following new function to the `MainVertical` class:

```java
Map<String, Object> getIdClaims(RoutingContext ctx) {
    try {
        JwtVerifier jwtVerifier = new JwtHelper()
            .setIssuerUrl(config().getString("issuer"))
            .setAudience("api://default")
            .setClientId(config().getString("clientId"))
            .build();

        Jwt idTokenJwt = jwtVerifier.decodeIdToken(ctx.user().principal().getString("id_token"), null);
        return idTokenJwt.getClaims();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        //do something with the exception...
        return new HashMap<>();
    }
}
```

And that's it! You can now access user information in your request handler. To demonstrate, the `/private/secret` handler can be updated to retrieve claims from the JWT as shown below:

```java
void startServer() {

    Router router = Router.router(vertx);
    AuthHandler authHandler = getOAuthHandler(router);
    router.route("/private/*").handler(authHandler);
    router.route("/private/secret").handler(ctx -> {

        Map claims = getIdClaims(ctx);
        ctx.response().end("Hi " +
                            claims.get("name") +
                            ", the email address we have on file for you is: "+
                            claims.get("email"));
    });

    vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(router::accept).listen(config().getString("port"));
}
```

With this final change, restarting your server and once again hitting `http://localhost:8080/private/secret`, your browser should now display a message with your authenticated user's information!
