Spring WebFlux can be used to create a REST API with streaming data. Spring WebFlux can also be integrated with WebSockets to provide notifications that clients can listen to. Combining the two is a powerful way to provide real-time data streaming to JavaScript or mobile clients. Add React to the mix and you have an excellent foundation for a full-stack reactive architecture.

React is a UI toolkit (similar to GWT) that lets you build components with JavaScript (or TypeScript) and JSX. JSX is how you define elements in React and it looks very similar to XML. React's API and JSX are the core of the framework; everything else is an add-on. I won't go into nitty-gritty details about React, we'll assume you've heard of it and are eager to learn how to make it even _more_ reactive!

image:{% asset_path 'blog/spring-webflux-apis/starbuxman.jpg' %}[alt=Josh Long,role="BlogPost-avatar pull-right img-100px"] I teamed up with https://twitter.com/starbuxman[Josh Long] to write this post. Josh is a fellow Java Champion, Spring Developer Advocate, and all around excellent guy at Pivotal. Josh and I've been good friends for a while now, sharing the same passion for Java, developers, and building bleeding-edge applications. We hope you like this series!

Today, we'll show you how to build a _full-stack_ application using Spring WebFlux for the API, WebSockets for notifications, and React for the UI. This article is the third in a three-part series about reactive programming and Spring WebFlux. The first two are listed below.

. link:/blog/2018/09/21/reactive-programming-with-spring[Get Started with Reactive Programming in Spring]
. link:/blog/2018/09/24/reactive-apis-with-spring-webflux[Build Reactive APIs with Spring WebFlux]

== Reactiveness in Spring WebFlux and React

You hear might hear the term _reactive_ a lot when you read about JavaScript frameworks. When you hear this term in the Java community, it usually refers to asynchronous I/O and non-blocking processes. Spring WebFlux provides an implementation of the reactive streams specification, which is a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure.

The term "reactive" is a bit different in the JavaScript community. It typically refers to how a UI _reacts_ to events happening in other parts of the app. JavaScript does asynchronous processing by default and this can be very useful on the client so as to prevent the browser from locking up.

So how do you go *full-stack reactive* and create an architecture that can handle streaming data from the server, and constantly update the client? You can use many techniques, and I'll show you a few today.

Some of your favorite web apps probably seem like they do real-time processing. They're constantly sending notifications and updating the UI based on events. This is because they contain code that listens (or polls) for server-side events.

== Get Started with Spring WebFlux and WebSockets

In the link:/blog/2018/09/24/reactive-apis-with-spring-webflux[last post] from this series, we built a `/profiles` endpoint and a `/ws/profiles` WebSocket endpoint. To begin, clone the repository from GitHub:

----
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-webflux-react-example.git full-stack-reactive
----

Rather than messing with security right away, you can disable Spring Security by commenting out its dependencies in `reactive-web/pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<!--<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-oauth2-jose</artifactId>
</dependency>-->
----

You'll also need to comment out all the code in `reactive-web/src/main/java/.../SecurityConfiguration.java`.

You'll need to have a MongoDB database instance running on your local machine on the default host, port, and accessible with the default username and password. If you're on a Mac, you can install it using `brew install mongodb`. If you're on Debian-based Linux distributions, you can use `apt install mongodb`. You can start MongoDB by running `mongod`.

You can start the application using `./mvnw spring-boot:run` in the `reactive-web` directory. If you hit its `/profiles` endpoint with https://httpie.org/[HTTPie], you'll see there's no data.

[source,shell]
----
$ http :8080/profiles
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
transfer-encoding: chunked

[]
----

To run this API with demo data, run `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=demo ./mvnw spring-boot:run`. This will cause the https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-webflux-react-example/blob/master/reactive-web/src/main/java/com/example/demo/SampleDataInitializer.java[`SampleDataInitializer`] to create a few generic profiles in MongoDB.

[source,shell]
----
$ http :8080/profiles
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
transfer-encoding: chunked
----
[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "email": "A@email.com",
        "id": "21f458fd-f718-4bcb-807d-b54d730433b9"
    },
    {
        "email": "C@email.com",
        "id": "6f470aef-a04b-4bf8-bd66-44d29c724c0b"
    },
    {
        "email": "B@email.com",
        "id": "84bab375-e8e3-4c86-b3d0-f4fc65987767"
    },
    {
        "email": "D@email.com",
        "id": "111249b2-e85b-4772-a610-f5ac5e496705"
    }
]
----

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080/ws.html` and you'll be greeted with a blank page. This page contains a WebSocket listener that produces alerts when new profiles are added.

[source,html]
----
<script>
  var socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/ws/profiles');
  socket.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
    window.alert('message from server: ' + event.data);
  });
</script>
----

There's a `create.sh` script you can run to create new profiles. When you run it, you'll see alerts in your browser.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-full-stack-reactive/create-profile.png' %}[alt=Create profile,width=800,align=center]

Pretty slick, eh? You have an API that provides a REST endpoint in a non-blocking fashion, _and_ it notifies you when new data arrives!

Now let's see how you can handle this data with React.

== Create an App with React

I recently did a poll to see what my Twitter followers preferred when developing React apps: JavaScript or TypeScript.

++++
<div style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 1.25rem">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For those of you developing with <a href="https://twitter.com/reactjs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@reactjs</a>, do you prefer to use JavaScript or TypeScript?</p>&mdash; Matt Raible (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1043539841831456768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>
++++

Since most people voted for TypeScript, and we happen to like it ourselves, we'll show you how to create a React app with Create React App and TypeScript.

Open a terminal window, navigate to the `full-stack-reactive` directory, and run the following command. This will install create-react-app, create a `react-app` directory and files, install all of its dependencies, and https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript[add TypeScript] support.

[source,bash]
----
npx create-react-app react-app --typescript
cd react-app
----

=== Create a ProfileList Component to Fetch Data from Your Spring WebFlux API

Create a `react-app/src/ProfileList.tsx` component that fetches data from the `/profiles` endpoint.

[source,tsx]
----
import React, { Component } from 'react';

interface Profile {
  id: number;
  email: string;
}

interface ProfileListProps {
}

interface ProfileListState {
  profiles: Array<Profile>;
  isLoading: boolean;
}

class ProfileList extends Component<ProfileListProps, ProfileListState> {

  constructor(props: ProfileListProps) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      profiles: [],
      isLoading: false
    };
  }

  async componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({isLoading: true});

    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/profiles');
    const data = await response.json();
    this.setState({profiles: data, isLoading: false});
  }

  render() {
    const {profiles, isLoading} = this.state;

    if (isLoading) {
      return <p>Loading...</p>;
    }

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Profile List</h2>
        {profiles.map((profile: Profile) =>
          <div key={profile.id}>
            {profile.email}<br/>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ProfileList;
----

To make this component render when your app loads, replace the code in `App.tsx` with the following.

[source,tsx]
----
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import ProfileList from './ProfileList';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <ProfileList/>
        </header>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
----

Before your React app can talk to your API, you'll need to proxy the requests from `http://localhost:3000/profiles` to `http://localhost:8080/profiles`. You can do this by adding a proxy setting to `react-app/package.json`.

[source,json]
----
"proxy": "http://localhost:8080"
----

Restart your Spring Boot app and start your React app with `npm start`. You should see a list of profiles at `http://localhost:3000`.

== Techniques for Streaming Data with React

Displaying data from your reactive API is cool, but wouldn't it be cooler if your UI was updated when new profiles were added? There are several ways you can implement this behavior, and I'll show you a few options today. It's possible this could change if y'all send us some better ideas. 😉

=== Polling with Interval

The easiest, and most costly, technique you can implement is to poll the server for new data every few seconds. The code below explains how this works.

.Polling With Interval
====
[source,tsx]
----
import React, { Component } from 'react';

interface Profile {
  id: number;
  email: string;
}

interface ProfileListProps {
}

interface ProfileListState {
  profiles: Array<Profile>;
  isLoading: boolean;
}

class ProfileList extends Component<ProfileListProps, ProfileListState> {
  private interval: any; // <1>

  constructor(props: ProfileListProps) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      profiles: [],
      isLoading: false
    };
  }

  async fetchData() {
    this.setState({isLoading: true});

    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/profiles');
    const data = await response.json();
    this.setState({profiles: data, isLoading: false});
  }

  async componentDidMount() {
    await this.fetchData(); // <2>
    this.interval = setInterval(() => this.fetchData(), 1000); // <3>
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }

  render() {
    const {profiles, isLoading} = this.state;

    if (isLoading) {
      return <p>Loading...</p>;
    }

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Profile List</h2>
        {profiles.map((profile: Profile) =>
          <div key={profile.id}>
            {profile.email}<br/>
          </div>
        )}
        <a href="/" className="App-link">Home</a>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ProfileList;
----
<1> Define a local `interval` variable so fetching will stop when the component is unmounted.
<2> Call `fetchData()` to get the initial set of data when component is mounted.
<3> Call `fetchData()` every 1000 milliseconds, or 1 second.
====

To test that this works, replace the code in `ProfileList.tsx` with the code above. Then add a `create-stream.sh` file to your `react-app` directory and populate it with the following:

[source,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash
port=${1:-8080}
count=0

profile () {
  ((count++))
  echo "posting #${count}"
  http POST http://localhost:${port}/profiles email="random${count}"
  if [ $count -gt 120 ]
  then
    echo "count is $count, ending..."
    break
  fi
}

while sleep 1; do profile; done
----

This creates a new profile record every one second, for 120 seconds. You will need to install https://httpie.org/[HTTPie] before running this script. Run it, open `http://localhost:3000`, and you should see the list getting refreshed as new data is added.

You'll probably notice it's a jarring experience because the list flickers as more data is added.

=== Polling with RxJS

A better way to do polling is with RxJS. You can install it using npm.

----
npm i rxjs@6.5.2
----

You can replace the `fetchData()`, `componentDidMount()`, and `componentWillUnmount()` with a single `componentDidMount()` method.

.Polling with RxJS
====
[source,typescript]
----
import { interval } from 'rxjs';
import { startWith, switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';
// other imports

class ProfileList extends Component<ProfileListProps, ProfileListState> {

  // constructor()

  async componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({isLoading: true});

    const request = interval(1000).pipe( // <1>
      startWith(0), // <2>
      switchMap(() => // <3>
        fetch('http://localhost:3000/profiles')
          .then((response) => response.json())
      ));

    request.subscribe((data: any) => { // <4>
      this.setState({profiles: data, isLoading: false});
    })
  }

  // render()
}

export default ProfileList;
----
<1> Start an `interval` Observable, running every one second.
<2> `startWith` indicates that it should fetch right away, which makes it so you don't need an initial data fetch.
<3> `switchMap` has a canceling effect, which is different from other flattening operators. On each emission, the previous inner observable (the result of `fetch()`) is canceled and the new observable is subscribed. Use `mergeMap` if you need every request to complete.
====

Restart your server to start with default data again, run `create-stream.sh`, and open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. You'll notice the profiles are updating, and there's no flicker in the page.

Fetching new data every few seconds is expensive and silly. Wouldn't it be cooler to take advantage of the WebSocket endpoint that notifies when new data arrives?!

=== Real-time Data with WebSockets

You don't need to install anything to use WebSockets. They're supported by most modern browsers. Below is a report from https://caniuse.com/#search=websocket[caniuse.com].

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-full-stack-reactive/caniuse-websocket.png' %}[alt=Can I use WebSocket,width=800,align=center]

With WebSockets, you just need a single `componentDidMount()` and no additional imports.

.WebSockets
====
[source,typescript]
----
// imports

class ProfileList extends Component<ProfileListProps, ProfileListState> {

  // constructor()

  async componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({isLoading: true});

    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/profiles');
    const data = await response.json();
    this.setState({profiles: data, isLoading: false});

    const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000/ws/profiles'); // <1>
    socket.addEventListener('message', async (event: any) => { // <2>
      const profile = JSON.parse(event.data);
      this.state.profiles.push(profile);
      this.setState({profiles: this.state.profiles}); // <3>
    });
  }

  // render()
}

export default ProfileList;
----
<1> Create a new `WebSocket`.
<2> Listen for new profiles.
<3> Update the profiles using `setState()`. Without this line, the UI won't be updated.
====

You will also need to create `src/setupProxy.js` so it proxies WebSocket requests.

[source,js]
----
const proxy = require("http-proxy-middleware")

module.exports = app => {
  app.use(proxy("/ws", {target: "http://localhost:8080", ws: true}))
}
----

After adding this file, you will need to restart your client for it to take effect.

WebSockets make it easy to get notifications from a WebFlux API, don't they?!

=== Listening for Server-Sent Events (SSE)

One last technique I'd like to show you is server-sent events (SSE). With SSE, it's possible for a send new data to a web client at any time, by pushing messages. Create a `ServerSentEventController.java` class and fill it with the following Java code.

.`reactive-web/src/main/java/com/example/demo/ServerSentEventController.java`
====
[source,java]
----
package com.example.demo;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.CrossOrigin;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

@RestController
public class ServerSentEventController {
    private final Flux<ProfileCreatedEvent> events;
    private final ObjectMapper objectMapper;

    public ServerSentEventController(ProfileCreatedEventPublisher eventPublisher, ObjectMapper objectMapper) {
        this.events = Flux.create(eventPublisher).share(); // <1>
        this.objectMapper = objectMapper;
    }

    @GetMapping(path = "/sse/profiles", produces = MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE) // <2>
    @CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000") // <3>
    public Flux<String> profiles() {
        return this.events.map(pce -> {
            try {
                return objectMapper.writeValueAsString(pce) + "\n\n"; // <4>
            } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        });
    }
}
----
<1> The `.share()` method is important to allow multiple clients to consume your data.
<2> You must use `MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE` to indicate you'll be sending streaming text.
<3> You have to allow access from the React app's origin because https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3391[Create React App's proxy doesn't support SSE].
<4> Return the `ProfileCreatedEvent` as a JSON string. I added the two carriage returns because a reader commented that they needed them.
====

On the React side of things, you can use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource[`EventSource`] to listen for new profiles. Change your `ProfileList` component to use `EventSource` as follows.

.Server-Sent Events and EventSource
====
[source,typescript]
----
// imports

class ProfileList extends Component<ProfileListProps, ProfileListState> {

  // constructor()

  async componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({isLoading: true});
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/profiles');
    const data = await response.json();
    this.setState({profiles: data, isLoading: false});

    const eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:8080/sse/profiles'); // <1>
    eventSource.onopen = (event: any) => console.log('open', event); // <2>
    eventSource.onmessage = (event: any) => {
      const profile = JSON.parse(event.data).source; // <3>
      this.state.profiles.push(profile);
      this.setState({profiles: this.state.profiles}); // <4>
    };
    eventSource.onerror = (event: any) => console.log('error', event);
  }

  // render()
}

export default ProfileList;
----
<1> Create a new `EventSource`, using port 8080 since you can't proxy server-sent events.
<2> Log when the channel is open. This was helpful to discover the issue with proxies because it was called, but `onmessage()` was not.
<3> Parse `event.data`, then grab the `source` from that.
<4> Remember to use `setState()` to update your UI!
====

If you restart your server, add some streaming data with `create-stream.sh`, you should see the screen constantly updating.

You've learned how to add real-time streaming abilities to your React app, but what about security? A system that broadcasts to everyone that's listening isn't going to work well, especially if we start adding sensitive data!

== Secure Your React App with OpenID Connect (OIDC)

OIDC requires an identity provider (or IdP). You can use many well-known ones like Google or Facebook, but those services don't allow you to manage your users as you would in Active Directory. Okta allows this, _and_ you can use Okta's API for OIDC.

I'd encourage you to https://developer.okta.com/signup/[signup for an Okta developer account], so you can learn how to secure your full stack reactive app. If you already have an account, great! Just follow the steps below to create a new OIDC app.

image::{% asset_path 'blog/spring-webflux-apis/okta-signup.png' %}[alt=Register for a free developer account,width=800,align=center]

=== Create an OIDC App in Okta

{uri-okta-login}[Log in] to your Okta Developer account and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Web** and click **Next**. Give the app a name you'll remember, specify `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta` and `http://localhost:3000/implicit/callback` as Login redirect URIs and click **Done**. Then edit the project and enable "Implicit (Hybrid)" as a grant type (allow ID and access tokens) and click **Save**.

Copy and paste the URI of your default authorization server, client ID, and the client secret into `reactive-web/src/main/resources/application.yml`.

[source,yaml]
----
oidc:
  issuer-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default

In the previous post, you locked down the backend with Spring Security and OIDC. Uncomment the Spring Security dependencies in your `pom.xml`.

To secure your front-end, you'll need to install Okta's React SDK, as well as react-router-dom. Using OktaDev Schematics greatly simplifies this process.

----
npm i @oktadev/schematics
npm i -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
schematics @oktadev/schematics:add-auth
----

When prompted, enter the same issuer and clientId you put into your `application.yml`.

The `react-app/src/App.tsx` file will be modified to add your Okta configuration and security-related React components.

[source,tsx]
----
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Security, ImplicitCallback } from '@okta/okta-react';
import Home from './Home';

const config = {
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  redirect_uri: window.location.origin + '/implicit/callback',
  client_id: '{clientId}'
};

export interface Auth {
  login(redirectUri: string): {};
  logout(redirectUri: string): {};
  isAuthenticated(): boolean;
  getAccessToken(): string;
}

class App extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <Security {...config}>
          <Route path="/" exact={true} component={Home}/>
          <Route path="/implicit/callback" component={ImplicitCallback}/>
        </Security>
      </Router>
    );
  }
}

export default App;

----

A `Home` component will be created in `react-app/src/Home.tsx` to serve as your landing page. Search for `{/* Replace me with your root component. */}` and replace it with `<ProfileList auth={this.props.auth}/>`.

<1> The `ProfileList` component will need to access `props.auth` to get an access token, so pass it in.
====

You'll need to update `ProfileList.tsx` to add `auth` to its required props (a.k.a., inputs) and to add an `authorization` header to server requests. While you're at it, change from using port 3000 to using port 8080.

[source,tsx]

import { Auth } from './App';

interface Profile {
  id: number;

  profiles: Array<Profile>;
  isLoading: boolean;
}

class ProfileList extends Component<ProfileListProps, ProfileListState> {

  constructor(props: ProfileListProps) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      profiles: [],
      isLoading: false
    };
  }

  async componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({isLoading: true});

    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/profiles', {
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer ' + await this.props.auth.getAccessToken()
      }
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    this.setState({profiles: data, isLoading: false});
  }

 render() {
   const {profiles, isLoading} = this.state;

   if (isLoading) {
     return <p>Loading...</p>;

   return (
     <div>
       <h2>Profile List</h2>
       {profiles.map((profile: Profile) =>
         <div key={profile.id}>
           {profile.email}<br/>

If you try to make requests to the backend with its current configuration, it'll fail because CORS hasn't been enabled. Modify `SecurityConfiguration.java` class to enable CSRF (for improved security) and CORS.

<1> Use `@EnableWebFluxSecurity` when using Spring WebFlux and Spring Security.
<2> Enable `@PreAuthorize` and other method-level security annotations.
<3> Unlike Spring MVC, where you override a method, you create a `SecurityWebFilterChain` bean with WebFlux.
<4> CSRF is enabled in this app, but we don't enable sending the CSRF header back because we're not manipulating data. If you want to POST, PUT, or DELETE, you will need to grab the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie's value and send it back as a `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header.
<5> WebSockets can't be secured. There are WebSocket libraries (e.g., Socket.IO) that allow sending an authorization header, but Spring WebFlux doesn't support them.
<6> Define a `CorsConfigurationSource` bean and CORS will be enabled for your API.
====

Restart and you should be able to log in and view data from your React app!

You might ask if you can deploy your React and Spring WebFlux app as a single artifact. Yes, this is possible, and you can see how to do it with the frontend-maven-plugin in link:/blog/2018/07/19/simple-crud-react-and-spring-boot[Use React and Spring Boot to Build a Simple CRUD App]. In this example, they're separate apps because this is what most of my followers seem to prefer.

== Secure Real-time Communication with React, Spring WebFlux, and WebSockets

Adding an authorization header to any `fetch()` requests will work for the interval and RxJS examples I showed. Ideally, it'd work for an EventSource and WebSockets too.

Unfortunately, neither of the raw EventSource or WebSocket APIs have support for passing additional headers. For EventSource, I found https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource/[Yaffle/EventSource] which is supposed to support additional headers. I also found a fork of it, https://github.com/AlexGalays/EventSource[AlexGalays/EventSource], that has TypeScript support and better support. Unfortunately, I was unable to get either library to work.

You might notice my comment above that you can't secure WebSockets. What I meant to say is they can't be secured when using WebFlux. When I tried to use https://socket.io/[socket.io] and it's `socket.io-client`, I ran into an "Invalid 'Upgrade' header:" error. Shortly after, I found https://stackoverflow.com/a/51600936[a Stack Overflow Q & A], asking about support for Socket.IO and SockJS.

[quote, 'https://twitter.com/bclozel[Brian Clozel]']
____
The Spring Framework team is not considering this feature right now in WebFlux. Because of the back-pressure support in reactive streams, the team is considering protocols that would leverage that information.

For example, rsocket support would fit that space and much more. See https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16751[SPR-16751].
____

I https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-js/issues/21[tried rsocket-js], but quickly realized Spring WebFlux was lacking the support I needed. _Duh! SPR-16751 is still open._

Josh and I put our heads together and decided the best workaround would be to modify the WebSocket endpoint so it only sends IDs. That way, no sensitive data is propagated. To do this, you'll need to modify `WebSocketConfiguration.java` to just send the ID, not the whole `Profile`.

.WebSocket with ID only
====
[source,java]
----
Flux<WebSocketMessage> messageFlux = publish.map(evt -> {
    try {
        Profile profile = (Profile) evt.getSource(); // <1>
        Map<String, String> data = new HashMap<>(); // <2>
        data.put("id", profile.getId());
        return objectMapper.writeValueAsString(data); // <3>
    } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}).map(str -> {
    log.info("sending " + str);
    return session.textMessage(str);
});

return session.send(messageFlux);
----
<1> Get the profile from the event.
<2> Create a map and stuff the id into it.
<3> Return the map as JSON.
====

NOTE: You could use a similar technique with server-sent events in the `ServerSentEventController`. The advantage of using WebSocket over EventSource is EventSource is read-only. WebSocket connections can both send data to the browser and receive data from the browser.

Then you can modify the code in `ProfileList.tsx` to fetch the profile securely.

.WebSockets in React
====
[source,typescript]
----
async componentDidMount() {
  this.setState({isLoading: true});
  const headers = {
    headers: {Authorization: 'Bearer ' + await this.props.auth.getAccessToken()} // <1>
  };

  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/profiles', headers); // <2>
  const data = await response.json();
  this.setState({profiles: data, isLoading: false});

  const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/ws/profiles');
  socket.addEventListener('message', async (event: any) => {
    const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
    const request = await fetch(`http://localhost:8080/profiles/${message.id}`, headers); // <3>
    const profile = await request.json();
    this.state.profiles.push(profile);
    this.setState({profiles: this.state.profiles});
  });
}
----
<1> Get the access token from Okta's React SDK.
<2> Make a secure request to get the initial profiles.
<3> When an event is received from the WebSocket connection, fetch the profile with the ID.
====

After making these changes, you should have an app that gets real-time updates from Spring WebFlux when new profiles are added.

You can prove this works by creating an access token using https://oidcdebugger.com/[OpenID Connect <debugger/>]. To use this, I had to add `https://oidcdebugger.com/debug` as a login redirect URI, and manually enter a state variable. Then I was able to modify `create-stream.sh` to use the access token when creating profiles.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
port=${1:-8080}
count=0
accessToken=<your access token>

profile () {
  ((count++))
  echo "posting #${count}"
  http POST http://localhost:${port}/profiles email="random${count}" "Authorization: Bearer ${accessToken}"
  if [ $count -gt 120 ]
  then
    echo "count is $count, ending..."
    break
  fi
}

while sleep 1; do profile; done
----
