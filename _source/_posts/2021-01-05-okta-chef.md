If you use Chef to automate configuration management across dynamic server fleets, there's a question about identity & access management – how do you get accounts and credentials on the machines?

A common practice is to push SSH Keys for every admin user to every server. This has major security implications, however. What happens when an administrator leaves the company? It is then up to someone to clear out those keys on each machine, oftentimes a manual process.

Another common practice is to front your servers with an LDAP interface, configuring a local PAM module on each machine to sync local server accounts with an upstream Identity Provider. This leaves a significant operational burden, however. Do you want to run an HA middleware service blocking your ability to scale in the cloud? This is a pain point no Ops Engineer wants.

In this tutorial, we will overcome both issues by seamlessly injecting Okta into your Chef Infrastructure as Code to effectively [Shift Identity Left](https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/07/shift-identity-left-secure-devops-automation-with-okta/):

**Note:** To follow this tutorial, you need to have an Advanced Server Access (ASA) team provisioned from your Okta Org. If you don't have an existing ASA team, you can sign up for free [here](https://app.scaleft.com/p/signupV2), which requires an Okta Administrator to [configure](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/setup/getting-started.htm).

## Download and configure cookbook

In your terminal, navigate to your chef home and clone our sample cookbook:

```sh
cd $CHEF_REPO/cookbooks
git clone https://github.com/okta-server-asa/asa-chef-example.git
```

Get an enrollment token in ASA:

1. Access Okta ASA as Administrator.
2. Click **Projects** and then select or create a new project.
3. Click **Enrollment** > **Create Enrollment Token**.
4. Enter a name (i.e. `chef-token`) and click **Submit**.
5. Copy the enrollment token:

{% img blog/okta-chef/asa-get-token.png alt:"Enrollment token page" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

Edit the `asa-chef-example/attributes/default.rb` file, replacing `ENROLLMENT_TOKEN` with the token from ASA:

```rb
default['asa_enrollment_token'] = 'ENROLLMENT_TOKEN'
```

To confirm your configuration has no typos, enter `cookstyle attributes/default.rb`:

```sh
# cookstyle attributes/default.rb
Inspecting 1 file
1 file inspected, no offenses detected
```

## Test cookbook

Now that we have the cookbook set, let's see it in action. To do this, I'll use [Chef Test Kitchen](https://kitchen.ci/) as a harness environment, and apply the cookbook into multiple Virtual Machines.

**Tip:** The sample cookbook has a script (`kitchen.yml`) that sets our test environment automatically using VirtualBox VMs managed with Vagrant.

### Launch test kitchen

In your environment with Chef workstation, install VirtualBox and Hashicorp Vagrant. (If you have a mac and homebrew, you can run the commands):

```sh
brew install virtualbox --cask
brew install vagrant --cask
```

Enter `VBoxManage list bridgedifs | grep Name` to get your computer network interface name that will be used by the test VMs (ideally, a network interface with Internet. In my case, its en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort):

```sh
# VBoxManage list bridgedifs | grep Name
Name:            en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort)
Name:            bridge0
VBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-bridge0
Name:            llw0
VBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-llw0
Name:            en12: USB 10/100/1000 LAN
VBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-en12
```

Edit and save the `kitchen.yml` file:

- In lines 25-29, define the list of servers/VMs you want to test. You can remove a specific servers or distro by adding a comment (`#+ space`). Example: `# - name: centos-7`.
- In line 35, paste the network interface name that will be used to bridge network connections. For example: `- ["public_network", { bridge: "en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort)" }]`

To setup your kitchen, enter: `kitchen create`

Chef Test Kitchen will download and launch all VMs in VirtualBox. This may take some time.

To confirm your kitchen is running, enter: `kitchen list`

The list will show you the VMs with last action Created:

```sh
# kitchen list
Instance                    Driver   Provisioner  Verifier  Transport  Last Action  Last Error
asa-chef-ubuntu-1804        Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      <None>
asa-chef-centos-7           Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      <None>
asa-chef-debian-107         Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      <None>
asa-chef-opensuse-leap-152  Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      <None>
asa-chef-oracle-82          Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      <None>
```

### Run cookbook in test kitchen

To install and enroll your servers on ASA, enter `kitchen converge`.

Chef will execute the cookbook and enroll all your servers in ASA.

In ASA, you will see your server enrolled in your project:

{% img blog/okta-chef/asa-list-servers-3.png alt:"Servers enrolled in Okta ASA" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

To confirm the recipe worked, enter `kitchen verify`:

```sh
-----> Verifying <asa-chef-oracle-82>...
       Loaded tests from {:path=>".asa-chef-example.test.integration.default"} 

Profile: tests from {:path=>"/asa-chef-example/test/integration/default"} (tests from {:path=>"asa-chef-example.test.integration.default"})
Version: (not specified)
Target:  ssh://vagrant@127.0.0.1:2203

  Service sftd
     ✔  is expected to be installed
     ✔  is expected to be enabled
     ✔  is expected to be running

Test Summary: 3 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
       Finished verifying <asa-chef-oracle-82> (0m1.09s).
```

## Test access to servers with Okta

Now that all servers are enrolled in Okta, let's access the servers as a user:

Install the ASA agent in your workstation (required to access servers as a user):

```sh
brew install okta-advanced-server-access --cask
```

To setup the ASA agent, enter `sft enroll` and follow the instructions.

To see your servers, enter `sft list-servers`.

```sh
# sft list-servers
Waiting on browser...
Browser step completed successfully.
HOSTNAME                    OS_TYPE  PROJECT_NAME         ACCESS_ADDRESS
asa-chef-ubuntu-1804        linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.101
asa-chef-centos-7           linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.102
asa-chef-debian-107         linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.103
asa-chef-opensuse-leap-152  linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.104
asa-chef-oracle-82          linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.105
```

To ssh into your server, enter `sft ssh <name-of-your-server>`:

```sh
# sft ssh asa-chef-ubuntu-1804
/home/frederico_hakamine #  
```

**Note:** Wait... what Okta ASA does for the login?

- Okta ASA secures access to Linux and Windows servers in SSH and RDP connections using a lightweight server agent. The agent works alongside native OS features such as sudo, users, and openssh to control access without a bloatware or an intrusive approach.
- Because the agent is light and does not require firewalls or monolith privileged access servers, it can be easily distributed across any infrastructure (IaaS, VM, or physical) and embedded in your DevOps tools.
- To grant users access to servers, ASA issues ephemeral ssh keys for the user workstation and the OS for access. The keys are issued only after ensuring both user and his/her device complies with the organization security policies.
- The use of ephemeral keys provides many benefits. It eliminates the use of static keys and credentials for server access, ensures that both users and machines are audited before any new ssh connection, simplifies access revocation, eliminates the risk of "super account overuse", and simplifies access audit.

## What's next?

After testing the cookbook on your Chef Kitchen, you can use it in your Chef Infra. To do so, tweak the cookbook (i.e. store the enrollment token on chef-vault or a data-bag), upload (`knife upload asa-chef-example`), and add the cookbook to specific roles and environments within your infrastructure:

{% img blog/okta-chef/chef-manage-recipe.png alt:"Managing the asa-chef-cookbook in Chef Infra" width:"800" %}{: .center-image }

You can also turn on additional features in Okta ASA, such as setup sudo grants, time-based access, use of bastion hosts, and session recording just to name a few. All these features reduce the load on your cookbooks and allow provide consistent account configuration across multiple servers.
