==========================
The Passlib Python Library
==========================

Welcome
=======
Passlib is a password hashing library for Python 2 & 3, which provides
cross-platform implementations of over 30 password hashing algorithms, as well
as a framework for managing existing password hashes. It's designed to be useful
for a wide range of tasks, from verifying a hash found in /etc/shadow, to
providing full-strength password hashing for multi-user application.

* See the `documentation <https://passlib.readthedocs.io>`_
  for details, installation instructions, and examples.

* See the `changelog <https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/history>`_
  for a description of what's new in Passlib.

* Visit `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/passlib>`_
  for the latest stable release.
  All releases are signed with the gpg key
  `4D8592DF4CE1ED31 <http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x4D8592DF4CE1ED31>`_.

* Additional questions about usage or features? Feel free to post on our
  `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/group/passlib-users>`_.

Usage
=====
A quick example of using passlib to integrate into a new application::

    >>> # import the context under an app-specific name (so it can easily be replaced later)
    >>> from passlib.apps import custom_app_context as pwd_context

    >>> # encrypting a password...
    >>> hash = pwd_context.hash("somepass")
    >>> hash
    '$6$rounds=36122$kzMjVFTjgSVuPoS.$zx2RoZ2TYRHoKn71Y60MFmyqNPxbNnTZdwYD8y2atgoRIp923WJSbcbQc6Af3osdW96MRfwb5Hk7FymOM6D7J1'

    >>> # verifying a password...
    >>> ok = pwd_context.verify("somepass", hash)
    True
    >>> ok = pwd_context.verify("letmein", hash)
    False

For more details and an extended set of examples, see the full documentation;
This example barely touches on the range of features available.

Source
=========
Passlib's source repository uses Mercurial.  When building Passlib from an hg clone, note that there are two main branches: ``default`` and ``stable``.

* ``default`` is the bleeding edge of the next major release. It may sometimes be of alpha quality. 
* ``stable`` is the latest released version plus any pending bugfixes, and should be safe to use in production.
