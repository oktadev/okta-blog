# PURPOSE
#
# This workflow will automatically merge in updates to pull request branches to
# ensure that pull requests are kept up-to-date with the branch they are based
# on.
#
# This helps prevent merge issues later when you're working on a PR and things
# in the main branch change.
#
# NOTE: This will NOT work on PR branches that are NOT in this repo. For
# example, if you fork our repo and write a blog post, then open a PR, this
# action will NOT be able to automatically merge the latest changes into the PR
# branch since it belongs to someone else.
